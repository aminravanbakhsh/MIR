A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.", "date": " 2020 ", "authors": ["Linda Wang", "Zhong Qiu Lin", "Alexander Wong"], "related_topics": ["deep learning", "convolutional neural network", "image processing", "computational biology *", "coronavirus infections / diagnostic imaging *"], "citation_count": "704", "reference_count": "46", "references": ["2194775991", "2949650786", "3001118548", "2962835968", "1686810756", "3008827533", "3005477624", "2919115771", "2108598243", "2963446712", "2511730936", "3007497549", "3010604545", "3008985036"]}, {"id": "2153579005", "title": "Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality", "abstract": "The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships.

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters.

Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67).\nConclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission.

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%).", "date": " 2009 ", "authors": ["Kevin Jarrett", "Koray Kavukcuoglu", "Marc'Aurelio Ranzato", "Yann LeCun"], "related_topics": ["feature extraction", "feature (machine learning)", "unsupervised learning"], "citation_count": "2,425", "reference_count": "54", "references": ["2151103935", "2161969291", "2310919327", "2112796928", "2100495367", "2162915993", "2110798204", "2130325614", "2097018403", "2166049352", "2155904486", "2134557905"]}, {"id": "2072128103", "title": "Learning Deep Architectures for AI", "abstract": "Can machine learning deliver AI? Theoretical results, inspiration from the brain and cognition, as well as machine learning experiments suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one would need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers, graphical models with many levels of latent variables, or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Each level of the architecture represents features at a different level of abstraction, defined as a composition of lower-level features. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but new algorithms have been discovered and a new sub-area has emerged in the machine learning community since 2006, following these discoveries.

We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions.

Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image.

A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions.

The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers.

AD has been applied in particular to optimization, parameter identification, nonlinear equation solving, the numerical integration of differential equations, and combinations of these. Apart from quantifying sensitivities numerically, AD also yields structural dependence information, such as the sparsity pattern and generic rank of Jacobian matrices. The field opens up an exciting opportunity to develop new algorithms that reflect the true cost of accurate derivatives and to use them for improvements in speed and reliability. This second edition has been updated and expanded to cover recent developments in applications and theory, including an elegant NP completeness argument by Uwe Naumann and a brief introduction to scarcity, a generalization of sparsity. There is also added material on checkpointing and iterative differentiation. To improve readability the more detailed analysis of memory and complexity bounds has been relegated to separate, optional chapters.The book consists of three parts: a stand-alone introduction to the fundamentals of AD and its software; a thorough treatment of methods for sparse problems; and final chapters on program-reversal schedules, higher derivatives, nonsmooth problems and iterative processes. Each of the 15 chapters concludes with examples and exercises. Audience: This volume will be valuable to designers of algorithms and software for nonlinear computational problems. Current numerical software users should gain the insight necessary to choose and deploy existing AD software tools to the best advantage.

However, training DNNs requires massive amounts of data and is very computationally intensive. Gaining analytical understanding of the solutions found by DNNs can help us devise more efficient training algorithms, replacing the commonly used mthod of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We analyze the dynamics of SGD and show that, indeed, direct computation of the solutions is possible in many cases. We show that a high performing setup used in DNNs introduces a separation of time-scales in the training dynamics, allowing SGD to train layers from the lowest (closest to input) to the highest. We then show that for each layer, the distribution of solutions found by SGD can be estimated using a class-based principal component analysis (PCA) of the layer's input. This finding allows us to forgo SGD entirely and directly derive the DNN parameters using this class-based PCA, which can be well estimated using significantly less data than SGD. We implement these results on image datasets MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 and find that, in fact, layers derived using our class-based PCA perform comparable or superior to neural networks of the same size and architecture trained using SGD. We also confirm that the class-based PCA often converges using a fraction of the data required for SGD.

To take this into account, non-crossing conditions can be imposed to constrain the geometry of networks, which consequently affects how they form, evolve and function. However, these constraints are not included in the theoretical frameworks that are currently used to characterize real networks5\u20137. Most tools for laying out networks are variants of the force-directed layout algorithm8,9\u2014which assumes dimensionless nodes and links\u2014and are therefore unable to reveal the geometry of densely packed physical networks. Here we develop a modelling framework that accounts for the physical sizes of nodes and links, allowing us to explore how non-crossing conditions affect the geometry of a network. For small link thicknesses, we observe a weakly interacting regime in which link crossings are avoided via local link rearrangements, without altering the overall geometry of the layout compared to the force-directed layout. Once the link thickness exceeds a threshold, a strongly interacting regime emerges in which multiple geometric quantities, such as the total link length and the link curvature, scale with the link thickness. We show that the crossover between the two regimes is driven by the non-crossing condition, which allows us to derive the transition point analytically and show that networks with large numbers of nodes will ultimately exist in the strongly interacting regime.

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease. In mouse, an axonal connectivity map showing the wiring patterns across the entire brain has been created using an EGFP-expressing adeno-associated virus tracing technique, providing the first such whole-brain map for a vertebrate species. With President Barack Obama's BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) initiative now entering year two, this issue of Nature presents two landmark papers that mobilize 'big science' resources to the cause. Hongkui Zeng and colleagues present the first brain-wide, mesoscale connectome for a mammalian species \u2014 the laboratory mouse \u2014 based on cell-type-specific tracing of axonal projections. The wiring diagram of a complete nervous system has long been available for a small roundworm, but neuronal connectivity data for larger animals has been patchy until now. The new three-dimensional Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a whole-brain connectivity matrix that will provide insights into how brain regions communicate. Much of the data generated in this project will be of relevance to investigations of neural networks in humans and should help to further our understanding of human brain connectivity and its involvement in brain disorders. In a separate report Ed Lein and colleagues present a transcriptional atlas of the mid-gestational human brain at high spatial resolution, based on laser microdissection and DNA microarray technology. The structure and function of the human brain is largely determined by prenatal transcriptional processes that initiate gene expression, but our understanding of the developing brain has been limited.

It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with only meager results. Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with relatively few points can it be solved exactly even using very large amounts of computer time. Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results. This paper will describe a computer-aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real time to solve large (100-200) point problems. This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as is the case in many of today's heuristics but it is asked to organize the data for the human in a fashion that allows the human to solve the problem easily.The techniques employed in this paper require that the computer and the human cooperate to find the solution to the problem in reasonable amounts of both of their times. The computer initially uses a series of heuristics that produce groups of points and some partial connections of these points. The human is asked to connect the points within the groups and then connect the groups in a manner that produces a circuit and appears to the human to maximize the ratio of enclosed area to perimeter. The computer takes this solution and uses another set of heuristics to make improvements. The solution is displayed to the human and if he is satisfied the procedure stops; if not the former procedure is repeated until the human is satisfied that cost for finding a better solution exceeds his estimate of the best possible improvement that could be obtained by further work.

It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with only meager results. Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with relatively few points can it be solved exactly even using very large amounts of computer time. Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results. This paper will describe a computer-aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real time to solve large (100-200) point problems. This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem solving abilities. The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as is the case in many of today's heuristics but it is asked to organize the data for the human in a fashion that allows the human to solve the problem easily.The techniques employed in this paper require that the computer and the human cooperate to find the solution to the problem in reasonable amounts of both of their times. The computer initially uses a series of heuristics that produce groups of points and some partial connections of these points. The human is asked to connect the points within the groups and then connect the groups in a manner that produces a circuit and appears to the human to maximize the ratio of enclosed area to perimeter. The computer takes this solution and uses another set of heuristics to make improvements. The solution is displayed to the human and if he is satisfied the procedure stops; if not the former procedure is repeated until the human is satisfied that cost for finding a better solution exceeds his estimate of the best possible improvement that could be obtained by further work.

Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.", "date": " 2002 ", "authors": ["Nigel R.

Due to the complexity of natural environments, the straightforward application of bottom-up visual saliency models is not sufficiently robust to predict the location of trails. As for other detection tasks, robustness can be increased by modulating the saliency computation based on a priori knowledge about which pixel-wise visual features are most representative of the object being sought. This paper proposes the use of the object's overall layout as the primary cue instead, as it is more stable and predictable in natural trails. Bearing in mind computational parsimony and detection robustness, this knowledge is specified in terms of perception-action rules, which control the behavior of simple agents performing as a swarm to compute the saliency map of the input image. For the purpose of tracking, multiframe evidence about the trail location is obtained with a motion-compensated dynamic neural field. In addition, to reduce ambiguity between the trail and trail-like distractors, a simple appearance model is learned online and used to influence the agents' activity. Experimental results on a large data set reveal the ability of the model to produce a success rate on the order of 97% at 20 Hz. The model is shown to be robust in situations where previous models would fail, such as when the trail does not emerge from the lower part of the image or when it is considerably interrupted. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "date": " 2013 ", "authors": ["Pedro Santana", "Lu\u00eds Correia", "Ricardo Mendon\u00e7a", "Nelson Alves", "Jos\u00e9 Barata"], "related_topics": ["robustness (computer science)", "active appearance model", "swarm behaviour"], "citation_count": "22", "reference_count": "58", "references": []}, {"id": "2108063263", "title": "The biological principles of swarm intelligence", "abstract": "The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects.

While the spatial order characterizing for example the crystals has been the basis of many advances in contemporary physics, most complex systems in nature do not offer such high degree of order. Many of these systems form complex networks whose nodes are the elements of the system and edges represent the interactions between them. \r\nTraditionally complex networks have been described by the random graph theory founded in 1959 by Paul Erdohs and Alfred Renyi. One of the defining features of random graphs is that they are statistically homogeneous, and their degree distribution (characterizing the spread in the number of edges starting from a node) is a Poisson distribution. In contrast, recent empirical studies, including the work of our group, indicate that the topology of real networks is much richer than that of random graphs. In particular, the degree distribution of real networks is a power-law, indicating a heterogeneous topology in which the majority of the nodes have a small degree, but there is a significant fraction of highly connected nodes that play an important role in the connectivity of the network. \r\nThe scale-free topology of real networks has very important consequences on their functioning. For example, we have discovered that scale-free networks are extremely resilient to the random disruption of their nodes. On the other hand, the selective removal of the nodes with highest degree induces a rapid breakdown of the network to isolated subparts that cannot communicate with each other. \r\nThe non-trivial scaling of the degree distribution of real networks is also an indication of their assembly and evolution. Indeed, our modeling studies have shown us that there are general principles governing the evolution of networks. Most networks start from a small seed and grow by the addition of new nodes which attach to the nodes already in the system. This process obeys preferential attachment: the new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes with already high degree. We have proposed a simple model based on these two principles wich was able to reproduce the power-law degree distribution of real networks. Perhaps even more importantly, this model paved the way to a new paradigm of network modeling, trying to capture the evolution of networks, not just their static topology.", "date": " 2001 ", "authors": ["Reka Zsuzsanna Albert", "Albert-Laszlo Barabasi"], "related_topics": ["degree distribution", "evolving networks", "hierarchical network model"], "citation_count": "24,926", "reference_count": "175", "references": ["2112090702", "2008620264", "2061901927", "2065769502", "3103071483", "2164727176", "2078206416", "2800860906", "1976969221", "2769133055", "3113109455", "2049951355", "2905110430"]}, {"id": "2013872595", "title": "Principles of condensed matter physics", "abstract": "Preface 1.

The communication system more likely to be used by ants in chemical mass recruitment is one in which the pheromone concentration on the trail is maintained constant by scout ants and is related to the quality of the food. Equilibration of recruitment is achieved by the ants by reacting to increasing ant densities on the food source, and on the trail, with decreasing recruitment efforts. The general conclusions that can be drawn from this theoretical analysis are the following: o  (a)   The participation of an important proportion of scout ants in therecruitment process is essential. The optimum proportion depends mainly on the distance to the food. The net result is a high percentage of ants on the trail returning to the nest without carrying any food.   (b)   Orientational cues different from the trail pheromone increase the recruitment efficiency.   (c)   Attraction to the trail and orientation along the trail to the foodsource need to be maintained as separate events. This can be achieved if there are two different behavioural thresholds towards the same pheromone ( Atta  for example) or if there are different pheromones for each purpose ( Myrmica  for example).   (d)   A decrease in recruitment effort at increasing ant densities on thetrail produces more efficient recruitment.

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100% of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth's prokaryotes contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth's prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 3 10 29 , 2.6 3 10 29 , 3.5 3 10 30 , and 0.25-2.5 3 10 30 , respectively. The numbers of het- erotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6-25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1-2 3 10 3 yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 3 10 30 cellsyyr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity. Although invisible to the naked eye, prokaryotes are an essential component of the earth's biota. They catalyze unique and indispensable transformations in the biogeochemical cy- cles of the biosphere, produce important components of the earth's atmosphere, and represent a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Although the abundance of prokaryotes has been estimated indirectly (1, 2), the actual number of pro- karyotes and the total amount of their cellular carbon on earth have never been directly assessed. Presumably, prokaryotes' very ubiquity has discouraged investigators, because an esti- mation of the number of prokaryotes would seem to require endless cataloging of numerous habitats. To estimate the number and total carbon of prokaryotes on earth, several representative habitats were first examined. This analysis indicated that most of the prokaryotes reside in three large habitats: seawater, soil, and the sedimentysoil subsur- face. Although many other habitats contain dense populations, their numerical contribution to the total number of pro- karyotes is small. Thus, evaluating the total number and total carbon of prokaryotes on earth becomes a solvable problem. Aquatic Environments.

We used these datasets to investigate the extent to which non-foraging nests within polydomous colonies are acting as: part of the colony expansion process; hunting and scavenging specialists; brood-development specialists; seasonal foragers; or a selfish strategy exploiting the foraging effort of the rest of the colony. We found that, rather than having a specialised role, non-foraging nests are part of the process of colony expansion. Polydomous colonies expand by founding new nests in the area surrounding the existing nests. Nests founded near food begin foraging and become part of the colony; other nests are not founded near food sources and do not initially forage.

However, workers were significantly less aggressive in encounters between kin if their queens had less active ovaries and were incompletely inseminated. Thus the presence of a fully functional queen continues to prevent recognition of unfamiliar kin in larger colonies, but worker cues can become more important when the queen is ineffective.

A component of the trail pheromone, methyl 4-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylate, was found to elicit similar recruitment behaviour to a natural trail.

(2) What determines which plant species are attacked? (3) Do leaf\u2014cutters optimize foraging in terms of energy expended by attacking palatable plants closest to the nest or do they distribute their efforts more or less evenly throughout their foraging territory? Several line of evidence support the hypothesis that A. cephalotes and A. colombica are selective in terms of plant material attacked. The ants sampled a large majority of the plant species present, but concentrated their foraging on a restricted subset of species. The mature leaves of only 31.4% and 22.0% of the species present were readily acceptable to A. colombica and A. cephalotes, respectively. The new leaves of another 12\u201416 plant species were acceptable. Different colonies of the same Atta species consistently attacked the same plant species if they were available, cut leaves from the same species at similar rates, and even attacked the same species of plants at the same time of year. The amount of material cut from host plant species was not correlated with host plant abundance in four of the six colonies studied, and was even slightly negatively correlated in two of these four. An analysis of plant distance from the nest versus amount harvested shows that palatable plant species close to the nest have a greater probability of being visited by the ants, but do not necessarily suffer more defoliation than other such plants within 50\u201460 m of the nest. Amount harvested decreases greatly for plants farther than 60\u201480 m from the nest. Thus colonies of Atta do not normally concentrate their efforts on plants closest to the nest, but foraging cannot be described as evenly distributed either. The factor responsible for selectivity in colonies of Atta is probably the internal chemistry of the material selected. An Atta colony must provide the fungus garden when a proper balance of nutrients and moisture without overlapping it with secondary compounds from the plants selected.

The center of their activities is the fungus garden, which is also the site of the queen and brood. The garden, in most species, is made from fresh green leaves or other vegetal material. The ants forage for this, forming distinct trails to the vegetation that is being harvested. The cut leaves or other substrate are brought into the nest and prepared for the fungus. Fresh leaves and flowers are cut into pieces a millimeter or two in diameter; the ants form them into a pulpy mass by pinching them with the mandibles and adding saliva. Anal droplets are deposited on the pieces, which are then forced into place in the garden. Planting of the fungus is accomplished by an ant9s picking up tufts of the adjacent mycelium and dotting the surface of the new substrate with it. The combination of salivary and anal secretions, together with the constant care given by the ants, facilitates the growth of the ant fungus only, despite constant possibilities for contamination. When the ants are removed, alien fungi and other organisms flourish.  A mature nest of Atta Sexdens may consist of 2000 chambers, some temporarily empty, some with refuse, and the remainder with fungus gardens. Thousands of kilograms of fresh leaves will have been used. A young laboratory colony of Atta cephalotes will use 1 kilogram of fresh leaves for one garden. The attines are the chief agents for introducing organic matter into the soil in tropical rain forests; this matter becomes the nucleus for a host of other organisms, including nematodes and arthropods, after it is discarded by the ants.

Smith) 1. The Organization of Mass-Foraging", "abstract": "Abstract     1.   1. Recruitment in mass foraging is organized almost exclusively by the use of the trail substance, which is secreted by Dufpur's gland and released through the extruded sting. The secretion is a powerful attractant, which excites workers and draws them out of the nest in the direction indicated by the trail. No other stimuli are required to induce this behaviour. The initial build-up of workers at food masses is exponential. The build-up decelerates towards a limit as workers become crowded on the food mass because (1) workers unable to reach the mass turn back without laying trails, and (2) the trail deposits of single workers evaporate within a few minutes. As a result, the number of workers at food masses tends to stabilize at a level which is a function of the area of the food mass. But the nature of the communication requires that the feed-back system have a lag of up to several minutes. The lag is measurable in the \u201covershoot\u201d of numbers of approaching workers and is a function of the distance of the food mass from the nest.   2.   2. Trail-laying, as measured by the extrusion of the sting, is an all-or-none response of individual workers; hence individual trails do not communicate quantity or quality of the food find. Quantity of food is communicated in the mass response by means of the negative feedback control of build-up just described. Quality is communicated by means of an \u201celectorate\u201d mass response, in which individuals choose whether to lay trails after inspecting the food find. The more desirable the food find, the higher the percentage of positive responses, the more the trail substance presented to the colony, and hence the more the newcomer ants that emerge from the nest.   3.   3. The trail substance is highly species-specific. In transposition experiments utilizing the fire ant species Solenopsis saevissima, S. geminata, and S. xyloni, it was found that the geminata secretion is certainly different from that of the other two species. The secretions of saevissima and xyloni are more interchangeable but appear to differ somewhat. The thief-ant S. molesta and members of other myrmicine genera tested also do not share the saevissima trail substances. Curiously, the Dufour's gland secretion of the dolichoderine species Monacis bispinosa causes a full response in saevissima workers, but M. bispinosa uses another substance for its trails.   4.   4. The foraging and homing behaviour of individual workers is partially analysed.

We used laboratory and field experiments to assess the mechanisms involved in dispersed central-place foraging in polydomous colonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, a widespread invasive species. Both in the laboratory and in the field, Argentine ants established new nests at sites located near food. Laboratory colonies of L. humile redistributed workers, brood and resources among nests in response to the spatial heterogeneity of food resources. In addition, laboratory colonies formed recruitment trails between nests in the context of foraging, providing a mechanism for the transport of material between nests.

The activity of the ants was variable and sometimes none of them moved for a few minutes, this inertia was broken by spontaneous movements of one ant which disturbed its neighbours.   2.   When a new source of food (rabbit liver) was added the behaviour of the population altered. Foragers, who appeared to find the food by undirected search, returned to the nest and entered in an \u201cexcited\u201d way, which is described. This excited behaviour caused all but one or two of the workers in the nest cell to leave the cell and feed at the liver. After a variable time the workers returned to the nest cell. The queen, who rarely foraged, was not fed at once by the returned workers, and often she solicited food without success for 20 minutes.   3.

The drift-rate-change hypothesis states that payoffs affect the drift rate of the decision process. The two-stage-processing hypothesis assumes two processes, one for processing payoffs and another for processing stimulus information, and that on a given trial, attention switches from one process to the other. The latter hypothesis gave the best account of their data. The present study investigated two questions: (1) Does the experimental setting influence decisions, and consequently affect the fits of the hypotheses? A task was conducted in two experimental settings\u2014either the time limit or the payoff matrix was held constant within a given block of trials, using three different payoff matrices and four different time limits\u2014in order to answer this question. (2) Could it be that participants neglect payoffs on some trials and stimulus information on others? To investigate this idea, a further hypothesis was considered, the mixture-of-processes hypothesis. Like the two-stage-processing hypothesis, it postulates two processes, one for payoffs and another for stimulus information. However, it differs from the previous hypothesis in assuming that on a given trial exactly one of the processes operates, never both.

However, the effect of fast transport on urban structures and society was not taken into account when developing these technical means. Technologists and economists have used indicators for expected benefits of these fast transport modes without taking into account the real system effects on society and urban structures. Plausible assumptions and hopes instead of scientific understanding of the complex system are used in practice. In contradiction to widely held beliefs of transportation planners, there is actually no growth of mobility if counted in number of trips per person per day, no time saving by increasing speed in the system, and no real freedom of modal choice.

We evaluated this parameter by measuring the polarization patterns of clear and cloudy skies using 180 degrees (full-sky) imaging polarimetry in the red (650 nm), green (550 nm) and blue (450 nm) ranges of the spectrum under clear and partly cloudy conditions. The resulting data were compared with the corresponding celestial polarization patterns calculated using the single-scattering Rayleigh model. We show convincingly that the pattern of the angle of polarization (e-vectors) in a clear sky continues underneath clouds if regions of the clouds and parts of the airspace between the clouds and the earth surface (being shady at the position of the observer) are directly lit by the sun. The scattering and polarization of direct sunlight on the cloud particles and in the air columns underneath the clouds result in the same e-vector pattern as that present in clear sky. This phenomenon can be exploited for animal navigation if the degree of polarization is higher than the perceptual threshold of the visual system, because the angle rather than the degree of polarization is the most important optical cue used in the polarization compass. Hence, the clouds reduce the extent of sky polarization pattern that is useful for animal orientation much less than has hitherto been assumed. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the shorter the wavelength, the greater the proportion of celestial polarization that can be used by animals under cloudy-sky conditions. As has already been suggested by others, this phenomenon may solve the ultraviolet paradox of polarization vision in insects such as hymenopterans and dipterans.

It has long been observed that meshedness increases with colony size within and across species, but no explanation has been provided so far. Since colony size is a strong factor controlling collective digging, a high value of the meshedness could simply be a side effect of a larger number of workers. To test this hypothesis, we study the digging dynamics in different group size of ants Messor sancta. We build a model of collective digging that is calibrated from the experimental data. Model's predictions successfully reproduce the topological properties of tunnelling networks observed in experiments, including the increase of the meshedness with group size. We then use the model to investigate situations in which collective digging progresses outward from a centre corresponding to the way tunnelling behaviour occurs in field conditions. Our model predicts that, when all other parameters are kept constant, an increase of the number of workers leads to a higher value of the meshedness and a transition from tree-like structures to highly meshed networks.

Young nurses are typically found deep within the nest where they tend to the queen and the brood, whereas older foragers are found near the entrance and outside the nest. 1 ,  2 ,  3  However, the individual-level maturation dynamics remain poorly understood because following individuals over relevant timescales is difficult; hence, previous experimental studies used same-age cohort designs. 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15  To address this, we used an automated tracking system to follow >500 individuals over >100\u00a0days and constructed networks of physical contacts to provide a continuous measure of worker social maturity. These analyses revealed that most workers occupied one of two steady states, namely a low-maturity nurse state and a high-maturity forager state, with the remaining workers rapidly transitioning between these states. There was considerable variation in the age at transition, and, surprisingly, the transition probability was age independent. This suggests that the transition is largely stochastic rather than a hard-wired age-dependent physiological change. Despite the variation in timing, the transition dynamics were highly stereotyped. Transitioning workers moved from the nurse to the forager state according to an S-shaped trajectory, and only began foraging after completing the transition.

To explain this unexpected result, we reasoned that the exclusion of ants from the canopies might also have excluded crawling insects that prey on aphids, such as the European earwig (Forficula auricularia L., Dermaptera: Forficulidae). Such a possibility is supported by the negative relationship between aphid density and the abundance of earwigs, consistent with a top-down control of aphids by earwigs. In contrast, the abundance of other aphid predators (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae, and Heteroptera) had no such negative effect on aphid density but a positive one, suggesting a bottom-up control, and showed no differences between control and ant-excluded trees.

These diminutive ants have long served as models for social insect behavior, leading to discoveries about social learning and inspiring hypotheses about the process of speciation and the evolution of social parasitism. This genus is highly morphologically and behaviorally diverse, and this has caused a great deal of taxonomic confusion in recent years. Past efforts to estimate the phylogeny of this genus have been limited in taxonomic scope, leaving the broader evolutionary patterns in Temnothorax unclear. To establish the monophyly of Temnothorax, resolve the evolutionary relationships, reconstruct the historical biogeography and investigate trends in the evolution of key traits, I generated, assembled, and analyzed two molecular datasets: a traditional multi-locus Sanger sequencing dataset, and an ultra-conserved element (UCE) dataset. Using maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and summary-coalescent based approaches, I analyzed 22 data subsets consisting of 103 ingroup taxa and a maximum of 1.8 million base pairs in 2485 loci. The results of this study suggest an origin of Temnothorax at the Eocene-Oligocene transition, concerted transitions to arboreal nesting habits in several clades during the Oligocene, coinciding with ancient global cooling, and several convergent origins of social parasitism in the Miocene and Pliocene. As with other Holarctic taxa, Temnothorax has a history of migration across Beringia during the Miocene.                            Temnothorax is corroborated as a natural group, and the notion that many of the historical subgeneric and species group concepts are artificial is reinforced.

The present account compares the organization of sensory input to the mushroom body's calyx in different Hymenoptera.

The lip receives antennal lobe afferents, and these olfactory input neurons can terminate in two or more segregated zones within the lip. The collar receives visual afferents that are bilateral with equal representation of both eyes in each calyx. Visual inputs provide two to three layers of processes in the collar subdivision. The basal ring is subdivided into two modality-specific zones, one receiving visual, the other antennal lobe input.

Similar results were obtained when the overall work demand is increased while keeping the colony size constant. Our model can reproduce a whole suite of distributions of the activity levels among colony members that have been found in empirical studies.

We measured behavioral and physiological responses of monkeys on a two- and four-choice direction-discrimination decision task. For both tasks, firing rates in the lateral intraparietal area appeared to reflect the accumulation of evidence for or against each choice. Evidence accumulation began at a lower firing rate for the four-choice task, but reached a common level by the end of the decision process. The larger excursion suggests that the subjects required more evidence before making a choice.

Before this small scientific revolution took place, structural aspects of mangrove forests wereviewed to be the result of abiotic processes acting from the bottom-up, while, at ecosystem level, the outwelling hypothesis stated that mangroves primary production was removed via tidal action and carried to adjacent nearshore ecosystems where it fuelled detrital based food-webs. The sesarmid crabs were the first macrofaunal taxon to be considered a main actor in mangrove structuring processes, thanks to a number of studies carried out in the Indo-Pacific forests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following these classical papers, a number of studies on Sesarmidae feeding and burrowing ecology were carried out, which leave no doubts about the great importance of these herbivorous crabs in structuring and functioning Old world ecosystems. Although Sesarmidae are still considered very important in shaping mangrove structure and functioning, recent literature emphasizes the significance of other invertebrates. The Ocypodidae have now been shown to have the same role as Sesarmidae in terms of retention of forest products and organic matter processing in New world mangroves. In both New and Old world mangroves, crabs process large amounts of algal primary production, contribute consistently to retention of mangrove production and as ecosystem engineers, change particle size distribution and enhance soil aeration. Our understanding of the strong impact of gastropods, by means of high intake rates of mangrove products and differential consumption of propagules, has changed only recently. The role of insects must also be stressed. It is now clear that older techniques used to assess herbivory rates by insects strongly underestimate their impact, both in case of leaf eating and wood boring species and that herbivorous insects can potentially play a strong role in many aspects of mangrove ecology. Moreover, researchers only recently realized that ant\u2010plant interactions may form an important contribution to our understanding of insect\u2010plant dynamics in these habitats. Ants seem to be able to relieve mangroves from important herbivores such as many insects and sesarmid crabs. It thus seems likely that ants have positive effects on mangrove performance. # 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Effects reviewed were plant herbivory, herbivore abundance, hemipteran abundance, predator abundance, plant biomass and reproduction in studies where ants were experimentally removed (n = 273 independent comparisons). Ant removal exhibited strong effects on herbivory rates, as plants without ants suffered almost twice as much damage and exhibited 50% more herbivores than plants with ants. Ants also influenced several parameters of plant fitness, as plants without ants suffered a reduction in biomass (-23.7%), leaf production (-51.8%), and reproduction (-24.3%). Effects were much stronger in tropical regions compared to temperate ones. Tropical plants suffered almost threefold higher herbivore damage than plants from temperate regions and exhibited three times more herbivores. Ant removal in tropical plants resulted in a decrease in plant fitness of about 59%, whereas in temperate plants this reduction was not statistically significant. Ant removal effects were also more important in obligate ant-plants (=myrmecophytes) compared to plants exhibiting facultative relationships with hemiptera or those plants with extrafloral nectaries and food bodies. When only tropical plants were considered and the strength of the association between ants and plants taken into account, plants with obligate association with ants exhibited almost four times higher herbivory compared to plants with facultative associations with ants, but similar reductions in plant reproduction. The removal of a single ant species increased plant herbivory by almost three times compared to the removal of several ant species.

Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.\r\n\r\nMany challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics.

For this reason we compared the total quantity and the qualitative composition of the odour blend among eleven maize cultivars and five wild Zea (Poaceae) species (teosinte), as well as among the offspring of eight Zea mays mexicana plants from a single population. Young plants were induced to release volatiles by mechanically damaging the leaves and applying oral secretions of Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) caterpillars to the wounded sites.

The total amounts of volatiles released were significantly different among maize cultivars as well as among the teosintes. Moreover, striking differences were found in the composition of the induced odour blends. Caryophyllene, for instance, was released by some, but not all varieties and teosintes, and the ratios among monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes varied considerably. The offspring of different mother plants of the Z. m. mexicana population showed some variation in the total amounts that they released, but the composition of the odour blend was very consistent within the population of this teosinte species.

The need to identify sources of biological control agents for importation added to this demand. Independently, biogeographers mapped species distributions to interpolate their niche requirements. Recently the threat of climate change caused an explosion in demand for guidance on likely shifts in potential distributions of species. The different technology platforms in the two sectors resulted in divergence in their approaches to mapping actual and potential species distributions under rapidly changing environmental scenarios. Much of the contemporary discussion of species mapping ignores the lessons from the history of pest species distribution modelling. This has major implications for modelling of the non-equilibrium distributions of all species that occur with rapid climate change. The current review is intended to remind researchers of historical findings and their significance for current mapping of all species. I argue that the dream of automating species mapping for multiple species is an illusion. More modest goals and use of other approaches are necessary to protect biodiversity under current and future climates. Pest risk mapping tools have greater prospects of success because they are generic in nature and so able to be used both to interpolate and to extrapolate from field observations of any species based on climatic variables.

We also determined critical thermal limits (CTLs) of activity of C. pomonella and the effect of different rates of cooling or heating on CTLs to complement the survival assays. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected adult C. pomonella survival with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Lethal temperatures, explored between \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C and 32\u00a0\u00b0C to 47\u00a0\u00b0C over 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4\u00a0h exposures, for 50% of the population of adult C. pomonella were \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h and 44\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Investigation of rapid thermal responses (i.e. hardening) found limited low temperature responses but more pronounced high temperature responses.

By contrast, critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were significantly affected by heating at these rates and ranged from 42.5 to 44.9\u00a0\u00b0C.

The high prevalence found in marmots and bats by sampling only one site on the body may indicate that mites are common inhabitants of their skin.

Moreover, two M. yumanensis bats harbored identical Neuchelacheles mites, indicating the possibility of interspecific cross-infection within a colony.

That evidence combined with observations of aphid mortality on those cultivars suggested that antibiosis-type resistance contributed to the expression of resistance. Possible donors of resistance to Dowling and Jackson were identified. In nonchoice tests, population development on PI 71506 was not significantly different from development on susceptible cultivars, indicating that antixenosis was more important in that genotype. Resistance was expressed in all plant stages. Dowling provided season-long protection against aphids equal to the use of the systemic insecticide imidacloprid [1-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine) in a field test. Four other germplasm accessions, 'Sugao Zarai', 'Sato', 'T260H', and PI 230977, had levels of resistance not significantly different from Dowling, Jackson, and PI 71506 in a choice test (P = 0.05).", "date": " 2004 ", "authors": ["Curtis B.

Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions. This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies). High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions. The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering (MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE). A test graph was built on the basis of 220 complexes annotated in the MIPS database. To evaluate the robustness to false positives and false negatives, we derived 41 altered graphs by randomly removing edges from or adding edges to the test graph in various proportions. Each clustering algorithm was applied to these graphs with various parameter settings, and the clusters were compared with the annotated complexes. We analyzed the sensitivity of the algorithms to the parameters and determined their optimal parameter values. We also evaluated their robustness to alterations of the test graph. We then applied the four algorithms to six graphs obtained from high-throughput experiments and compared the resulting clusters with the annotated complexes. This analysis shows that MCL is remarkably robust to graph alterations. In the tests of robustness, RNSC is more sensitive to edge deletion but less sensitive to the use of suboptimal parameter values. The other two algorithms are clearly weaker under most conditions. The analysis of high-throughput data supports the superiority of MCL for the extraction of complexes from interaction networks.", "date": " 2006 ", "authors": ["Sylvain Broh\u00e9e", "Jacques van Helden"], "related_topics": ["cluster analysis", "interactome", "robustness (computer science)", "algorithms *", "cluster analysis *"], "citation_count": "927", "reference_count": "43", "references": ["2159675211", "2084619201", "2065304353", "2130790725", "3103636110", "2018045523", "2167869241", "2037036397", "2116117181", "2136850043", "2050721857"]}, {"id": "2096125280", "title": "The conflicting relationships between aphids and men: A review of aphid damage and control strategies", "abstract": "In this review, after giving some figures on the economic impact of aphids on agricultural production, we describe the different mechanisms leading to yield losses (direct damage due to sieve drain and plant reaction, indirect damage, often the most important, due to virus transmission).

One patch represents an open habitat while the other is a refuge for prey. It is assumed that prey maximize their fitness measured by the instantaneous per capita growth rate. In each patch population dynamics is described by the Lotka\u2013Volterra time continuous model. The refuge is characterized by its protectiveness which is inversely related to the predation risk for prey, and the dependence of population dynamics on protectiveness is studied. It is shown that adaptive behavior of prey changes qualitative properties of the underlying Lotka\u2013Volterra model due to the appearance of a bounded attractor. Adaptive prey behavior does not lead to a stable equilibrium but to the reduction of population fluctuations. Dynamic consequences of a limited carrying capacity of the refuge are also considered. Low refuge carrying capacity leads to stability of predator\u2013prey dynamics while stability is lost when the carrying capacity of the refuge is high.

The processes of aphid settling and reproduction on plants therefore have a direct economic impact, and a better understanding of these events may lead to improved management strategies. Aphids are also important model organisms in the analysis of population differentiation and speciation in animals, and new ideas on plant utilization influence our understanding of the mechanisms generating biological diversity. Recent research suggests that the dominant cues controlling plant preference and initiation of reproduction are detected early during the stylet penetration process, well before the nutrient supply (phloem) is contacted. Aphids regularly puncture cells along the stylet pathway and ingest cytosolic samples, and the cues stimulating settling and parturition likely are metabolites present in peripheral (nonvascular) plant cells.

Analysis of the composition and emission pattern of volatiles in the model plant Arabidopsis showed that a range of volatile components are released, primarily from flowers. Most of the volatiles detected were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which in contrast to other volatiles showed a diurnal emission pattern. The active terpenoid metabolism in wild-type Arabidopsis provoked us to conduct an additional set of experiments in which transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing two different terpene synthases were generated. Leaves of transgenic plants constitutively expressing a dual linalool/nerolidol synthase in the plastids (FaNES1) produced linalool and its glycosylated and hydroxylated derivatives. The sum of glycosylated components was in some of the transgenic lines up to 40- to 60-fold higher than the sum of the corresponding free alcohols. Surprisingly, we also detected the production and emission of nerolidol, albeit at a low level, suggesting that a small pool of its precursor farnesyl diphosphate is present in the plastids. Transgenic lines with strong transgene expression showed growth retardation, possibly as a result of the depletion of isoprenoid precursors in the plastids. In dual-choice assays with Myzus persicae, the FaNES1-expressing lines significantly repelled the aphids. Overexpression of a typical cytosolic sesquiterpene synthase resulted in the production of only trace amounts of the expected sesquiterpene, suggesting tight control of the cytosolic pool of farnesyl diphosphate, the precursor for sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis.

The production of new cells begins during the first larval stages and is completed within a few days after pupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of adult optic centers appears to be independent of the larval optic center and also of adult eye development which does not get underway until pupation. At pupation the larval stemmata migrate toward the brain along the stemmatal nerve which persists and later serves as the framework by which ommatidial neurones reach the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nGanglion cells of the adult optic lobe are produced by two coiled rod-like aggregates of neuroblasts, the inner and outer optic lobe anlagen, which lie lateral to the protocerebrum and are already present in the brain of the newly hatched larva. Neuroblasts of the anlagen divide both symetrically to produce more neuroblasts and asymmetrically to yield one neuroblast and one smaller cell, the ganglion-mother cell. Subsequent ganglion-mother cell divisions produce the new ganglion cells which are continuously displaced from the anlage by additional cells. Following pupation mitotic activity in the anlagen diminishes and neuroblasts degenerate. By the fourth day after pupation the anlagen have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nFiber differentiation begins within a few days of cell formation. Fibers travel in bundles usually toward the center of the coiled anlagen where they form the neuropile masses. With contributions from a growing population of ganglion cells, fibermasses grow rapidly in size and complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThe geometric arrangement of anlagen, cortices, and neuropile is dynamic and interdependent. Progressive changes in anlagen configuration result from the combined effects of an increasing neuroblast population, growing optic cortices, and expanding fibermasses between the arms of the anlagen. In turn, the cortices and fibermasses which follow anlagen contours also change form. The complex of these parts, initially small and coiled, gradually enlarges and uncoils until at the time of anlagen degeneration the three optic fibermasses and their cortices are in approximately their final arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nThe outer anlage forms cells of the lamina cortex at its lateral rim and cells of the medulla at its medial rim. Cells of the lobula cortex are produced by strands of inner anlage neuroblasts extending laterally between the arms of the coiled outer anlage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nCells of the medulla cortex are first seen during the second larval instar and several days later the medulla fibermass is discernible. Cortex and fibermass lie medial to the outer anlage which is moved progressively more laterally as more cells are produced. Cells labelled with H3-Td R at the beginning of the third instar become the tangential cells of the adult optic lobe. Those labelled at the fourth and fith stages occupy positions near the tangential cells, and those labelled at pupation ultimately lie at the lateral edge of the cortex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nProduction of the lamina cortex begins later and procedes more slowly. Cells here are first apparent during the fourth instar and form a cellular cap covering the lateral part of the optic lobe. Labelling studies show that the earliest formed cells finally occupy the most posterior region of the lamina cortex. The lamina fibermass is first seen in the mid-fifth instar brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nFor most of larval life the lobula cortex forms a plug of cells just inside the lamina. While the anlage remains coiled, the first-formed cells are at the center of the plug, but ultimately they lie at the most medial part of the cortex. Production of lobula cells begins during the third instar and by the mid-fourth instar the lobula neuropile can be seen medial to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these studies with H3-Td R injection and fixation after varying intervals it has been possible to estimate the age of cells at a particular developmental stage.

Both of these approaches require the encoding of heading information, which can be represented as an allocentric or egocentric azimuthal angle. Recently, Ca2+ correlates of landmark position and heading direction, in egocentric coordinates, were observed in the ellipsoid body (EB), a ring-shaped processing unit in the fly central complex (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015). These correlates displayed key dynamics of so-called ring attractors, namely: 1) responsiveness to the position of external stimuli, 2) persistence in the absence of external stimuli, 3) locking onto a single external stimulus when presented with two competitors, 4) stochastically switching between competitors with low probability, and 5) sliding or jumping between positions when an external stimulus moves. We hypothesized that ring attractor-like activity in the EB arises from reciprocal neuronal connections to a related structure, the protocerebral bridge (PB). Using recent light-microscopy resolution catalogues of neuronal cell types in the PB (Wolff et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2013), we determined a connectivity matrix for the PB-EB circuit. When activity in this network was simulated using a leaky-integrate-and-fire model, we observed patterns of activity that closely resemble the reported Ca2+ phenomena. All qualitative ring attractor behaviors were recapitulated in our model, allowing us to predict failure modes of the putative PB-EB ring attractor and the circuit dynamics phenotypes of thermogenetic or optogenetic manipulations.

Here we review our current understanding of processing of optic flow as generated by an animal's self-motion. Optic flow processing is accomplished in a series of steps: First, the time-varying photoreceptor signals are fed into a two-dimensional array of Reichardt-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). EMDs compute, in parallel, local motion vectors at each sampling point in space. Second, the output signals of many EMDs are spatially integrated on the dendrites of large-field tangential cells in the lobula plate. In the third step, tangential cells form extensive interactions with each other, giving rise to their large and complex receptive fields. Thus, tangential cells can act as matched filters tuned to optic flow during particular flight maneuvers.

Both of these approaches require the encoding of heading information, which can be represented as an allocentric or egocentric azimuthal angle. Recently, Ca2+ correlates of landmark position and heading direction, in egocentric coordinates, were observed in the ellipsoid body (EB), a ring-shaped processing unit in the fly central complex (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015). These correlates displayed key dynamics of so-called ring attractors, namely: 1) responsiveness to the position of external stimuli, 2) persistence in the absence of external stimuli, 3) locking onto a single external stimulus when presented with two competitors, 4) stochastically switching between competitors with low probability, and 5) sliding or jumping between positions when an external stimulus moves. We hypothesized that ring attractor-like activity in the EB arises from reciprocal neuronal connections to a related structure, the protocerebral bridge (PB). Using recent light-microscopy resolution catalogues of neuronal cell types in the PB (Wolff et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2013), we determined a connectivity matrix for the PB-EB circuit. When activity in this network was simulated using a leaky-integrate-and-fire model, we observed patterns of activity that closely resemble the reported Ca2+ phenomena.

Now, using state-of-the-art genetics and electrophysiology, Alexander Borst and colleagues confirm the similarity between vertebrate and insect retinal circuitry, this time at the functional level. They have distinguished motion-sensitive neurons responding to abrupt increases in light (ON-neurons), from those specific for light decrements (OFF-neurons), in the fruitfly Drosophila. Clearly, the selection pressure for efficient motion detection through variations in light intensity has generated similar circuitries in these evolutionarily distant species.

Using state-of-the-art genetics and electrophysiology in the fruitfly, these authors distinguish motion-sensitive neurons responding to abrupt increases in light from those specific to light decrements, thus bringing the similarity with vertebrate circuitry to the functional level. Motion vision is a major function of all visual systems, yet the underlying neural mechanisms and circuits are still elusive. In the lamina, the first optic neuropile of Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptor signals split into five parallel pathways, L1\u2013L51. Here we examine how these pathways contribute to visual motion detection by combining genetic block and reconstitution of neural activity in different lamina cell types with whole-cell recordings from downstream motion-sensitive neurons2,3. We find reduced responses to moving gratings if L1 or L2 is blocked; however, reconstitution of photoreceptor input to only L1 or L2 results in wild-type responses. Thus, the first experiment indicates the necessity of both pathways, whereas the second indicates sufficiency of each single pathway. This contradiction can be explained by electrical coupling between L1 and L2, allowing for activation of both pathways even when only one of them receives photoreceptor input. A fundamental difference between the L1 pathway and the L2 pathway is uncovered when blocking L1 or L2 output while presenting moving edges of positive (ON) or negative (OFF) contrast polarity: blocking L1 eliminates the response to moving ON edges, whereas blocking L2 eliminates the response to moving OFF edges.

Basic nutritional information is, however, lacking for many associations, including the relative roles of microbial and intrinsic sources of cellulose degradation in many insects and B-vitamin provisioning by microorganisms in blood-feeding insects.\r\n3Some nutritional interactions between insects and their symbiotic microorganisms vary among conspecifics and closely related species. This variation can, in principle, contribute to nutritional explanations for variation in the abundance and distribution of insects. For example, the plant utilization traits of phloem-feeding aphids and stinkbugs have been demonstrated to depend on the identity of microbial partners. Evidence that associations can evolve rapidly comes from the demonstration that the impact of the bacterium Wolbachia on natural populations of its insect host can change from deleterious to beneficial within two decades.\r\n4Developing genomic tools, especially massively parallel sequencing and metagenomic analyses, offer the opportunity to explore the metabolic capabilities of symbiotic microorganisms and their insect hosts, from which defined hypotheses of nutritional function can be constructed.

Over 200 articles were published in scientific journals on various aspects of locust phase polyphenism, markedly advancing the knowledge of the subject. However, the chapter refers to the older literature when background information is necessary for complementary and better treatment, or because of historical importance. Some of the recent publications report contradictory findings, and such contradictions have been emphasized in the chapter. Substantial progress has been made in the study of locust phase polyphenism over the past several years. The topic has well and truly emerged from the realms of applied entomology to assume a prominent position in the modern study of phenotypic plasticity, whereby adaptive phenotypes arise during development as a result of plastic interactions between genes and the environment. The study of behavioral gregarization has seen some of the most far-reaching progress. The involvement of locust-emitted volatiles in aspects of phase biology has generated substantial research and its fair share of productive controversy. It has been especially heartening to see that some of the major areas of controversy, such as the role of phenylacetonitrile, appear to have been at least partially resolved during the past year. New genetic resources also offer a solution to a more prosaic problem in locust research.

But although the fact of the existence of biological races is well known, their mode of origin is, in most cases, in dispute. It is not known how far the biological characters of such races are germinally fixed, and it has been suggested that in many cases a group of individuals may become restricted to certain host species not by any germinal change, but by a kind of conditioning, as a result of which the adult female is attracted for oviposition to the particular species on which she had fed as a larva. This is the idea behind the so-called \"Host Selection Principle\" of Walsh, and it is a possibility which must be care\u00adfully considered when assessing the value of experiments attempting to establish the inheritance of acquired characters. It is obvious that if a conditioning of this sort was actually occurring, a polyphagous insect species might rapidly become split into two or more populations each attached to a given species of host (plant or animal as the case may be). The barrier thus created might persist for a very long time without any hereditary specialization taking place. It is known, however, that the characters which distinguish biological races are in fact often germinally fixed, and in some instances it has been shown that even though all structural differences are absent there may be repugnance for cross\u00adbreeding between two biological races of the same species (Thorpe 1930 b ).

In E.coli, recA is nearly essential for cell survival in the presence of DNA damage. However, recA was originally identified, as a gene required to obtain recombinant DNA molecules in conjugating bacteria. As a result, it has been frequently assumed that recA promotes the survival of bacteria containing DNA damage by recombination in which DNA strand exchanges occur. We now know that several of the processes that interact with or are controlled by recA, such as excision repair and translesion synthesis, operate to ensure that DNA replication occurs processively without strand exchanges. Yet the view persists in the literature that recA functions primarily to promote recombination during DNA repair. With the benefit of hindsight and more than three decades of additional research, we reexamine some of the classical experiments that established the concept of DNA repair by recombination, and we consider the possibilities that recombination is not an efficient mechanism for rescuing damaged cells, and that RecA may be important for maintaining processive replication in a manner that does not generally promote recombination.

Cellular events during brain morphogenesis.", "abstract": "1. Cellular morphogenesis during postembryonic brain development inDanaus plexippus plexippus L. was examined using histological techniques including radioautography. 2. The production of new neurones is continuous throughout larval and pupal stages and shows no fluctuations corresponding to ecdysis. Glial cell production, on the other hand, occurs at the time of molting. 3. New ganglion cells are formed by the division of neuroblasts found in aggregates or isolated among larval ganglion cells. Asymmetrical neuroblast divisions yield one neuroblast and one ganglion-mother cell which then divides at least once to form the new ganglion cells. Such divisions begin earlier inDanaus than in other investigated Lepidoptera. Symmetrical divisions yielding two neuroblasts also occur, but only among aggregated neuroblasts. 4. Radioautographs of brains fixed at progressive intervals after Tritiated Thymidine (H3TdR) injection have permitted description of the basic pattern by which cells of the adult brain cortex are laid out and progressive changes in the relationship of new ganglion cells derived from a single neuroblast. Ganglion-mother cells are deposited between the neuroblast and the neuropile, thus forming a row of cells which move the neuroblast progressively farther from the neuropile. New ganglion cells produced by ganglion-mother cell mitoses, which usually are oriented at 45\u00b0 angles to the neuropile, expand the cell cluster. Differentiating fibers of these cells are apparent within a few days of their production and seem to enter the neuropile in one bundle. Later with increased neuropile volume and further cell differentiation the cells are no longer clumped and thus are not recognizable as offspring of a single neuroblast. 5. Neuroblasts found scattered among the larval ganglion cells arise from cells near the neuropile. These cells, at first indistinguishable from their neighbors, gradually assume the size and ready stainability of neuroblasts and subsequently divide according to the pattern described above. 6. Scattered neuroblasts degenerate beginning shortly after pupation and have completely disappeared by the end of the fourth day. 7. Except in the developing optic lobe, glial cell numbers increase through the proliferation of already existing glial cells. All glial cells show H3TdR uptake during a 12 hour period surrounding each larval-larval molt and for a somewhat longer period after pupation. However, in the larval stages mitotic figures were seen only among glial I, II, and IV. Glial I cells divide through the entire last larval stage and for two days following pupation. Large irregular mitoses seen among glial III cells at pupation indicate that these cells are probably polyploid. 8. In the newly forming adult optic lobe glial II, III, and IV cells appear to develop from preganglion cells or cells indistinguishable from them. These cells gradually stain more and more darkly, segregate into the normal glial positions, and subsequently divide in accord with other glial cells. 9. At the end of the fifth instar the perineurium (glial I cells), which begins to thicken during the third larval instar, is multilayered and contains many vacuolar cells. Just prior to pupation the neurilemma begins to disintegrate and during the next five days all but the cells closest to the brain disappear. Hemocytes are seen to engulf portions of the disintegrating neurilemma and already degenerating perineurial cells, but do not seem to engulf live cells. The glial I cells remaining adjacent to the brain secrete a new neurilemma. 10. There is no evidence for mass destruction of larval ganglion cells by either autolysis or phagocytosis, and only in the antennal center is there evidence of degeneration of larval cells (NORDLANDER andEDWARDS, in press).", "date": " 1969 ", "authors": ["Ruth H Nordlander", "John S Edwards"], "related_topics": ["neuroblast", "brain morphogenesis", "cellular differentiation", "neurilemma", "mitosis", "ganglion", "ecdysis", "cell", "cell biology", "anatomy", "biology"], "citation_count": "153", "reference_count": "23", "references": ["2150912846", "2009763884", "1997831655", "2334615730", "2082495590", "2139828095", "1996194084", "2176550478", "2060415475", "2133967410"]}, {"id": "2018643684", "title": "Genome sequence of the endocellular obligate symbiont of tsetse flies, Wigglesworthia glossinidia.", "abstract": "Many insects that rely on a single food source throughout their developmental cycle harbor beneficial microbes that provide nutrients absent from their restricted diet.

To understand further the components and mechanisms involved in carotenoid synthesis, we screened Arabidopsis for mutations that disrupt this pathway and cause accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two nonallelic albino mutations, pds1 and pds2 (for phytoene desaturation), that are disrupted in phytoene desaturation and as a result accumulate phytoene, the first C40 compound of the pathway. Surprisingly, neither mutation maps to the locus encoding the phytoene desaturase enzyme, indicating that the products of at least three loci are required for phytoene desaturation in higher plants. Because phytoene desaturase catalyzes an oxidation reaction, it has been suggested that components of an electron transport chain may be involved in this reaction. Analysis of pds1 and pds2 shows that both mutants are plastoquinone and tocopherol deficient, in addition to their inability to desaturate phytoene. Separate steps of the plastoquinone/tocopherol biosynthetic pathway are affected by these two mutations. The pds1 mutation affects the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase because it can be rescued by growth on the product but not the substrate of this enzyme, homogentisic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, respectively. The pds2 mutation most likely affects the prenyl/phytyl transferase enzyme of this pathway. Because tocopherol-deficient mutants in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus can synthesize carotenoids, our findings demonstrate conclusively that plastoquinone is an essential component in carotenoid synthesis.

These results cannot, however, be immediately combined to give the response of the eye as a whole (with natural pupil) until the possible effects of the efficiency of light entering the eye through different parts of the pupil have been investigated. It has been found (Stiles and Crawford 1933) that light entering the eye near the periphery of the pupil is less efficient in producing the sensation of brightness than light entering near the centre. Probably the same thing occurs for the threshold of the sensation of brightness, so that the threshold would be higher for light passing through the more peripheral parts of the pupil. The first part of this paper is concerned with the testing of this hypothesis. The results are expressed in the form of curves connecting brightness threshold with distance of the point of entry of the light from the centre of the pupil, these curves being called, for convenience, threshold efficiency curves. The measurements of this effect made hitherto have related to the foveal region of the retina and a fairly high field brightness. They are here extended, by the threshold brightness method, to regions of the retina more or less distant from the fovea and to field brightnesses extending down to zero. In order to complete the picture of the luminous efficiency effect, in so far as it relates to white light, it remains only to investigate the course of the variation in shape of the threshold efficiency curve with time after the field brightness is changed suddenly from one value to another. One case only has been dealt with, namely, the change from a high value of field brightness to zero.

In three mutants the phenotype was related to specific point mutations in pds, the gene encoding phytoene desaturase. Since the resistance was manifested in a cell-free carotenogenic assay, it is evident that the predicted amino acid changes in the target protein alter the enzyme-herbicide interactions. In addition, the mutations also reduced the in vitro activity of phytoene desaturase. Increased levels of the substrate phytoene, accompanied by a reduction in colored carotenoids, were detected in cells of each of the mutant strains. A correlation was established between the degree of increase in the steady-state levels of phytoene and the extent of reduction in total carotenoid content in the cells. These two phenomena in turn are correlated with the rate of enzymatic activity of phytoene desaturase that was measured in vitro. Hence we deduce that phytoene desaturation is a rate-limiting step in carotenogenesis in cyanobacteria.

Embryo-defective (emb) mutations were chosen because they represent the most common heritable defect identified following mutagenesis in Arabidopsis. Multiple marker lines with easily scored phenotypes were constructed to facilitate mapping efforts. Recombination data were obtained for 169 mutants defective in embryo-genesis. The chromosomal locations of 110 emb genes are presented in this report. Twenty-six of these genes are tagged with T-DNA. Nine other mutants isolated following seed transformation appear to contain chromosomal translocations. Another 31 mutant genes in the collectiohave been assigned to a linkage group but not yet placed on the map. Nineteen examples of duplicate alleles have also been found. This is consistent with the estimate that approximately 500 genes readily mutate to give an embryo-defective phenotype in Arabidopsis.

The mutation is somatically unstable, and the degree of sectoring is influenced by light and temperature. Whereas the cells in the green sectors contain normal chloroplasts, the cells in the white sectors are heteroplastidic and contain non-pigmented plastids that lack organized lamellar structures, as well as small pigmented plastids and/or rare normal chloroplasts. This indicates that the plastids in im white cells are not affected equally by the nuclear mutation and that the expression of immutans is \u2018plastid autonomous\u2019. In contrast to other variegation mutants with heteroplastidic cells, the defect in im is not maternally inherited. immutans thus represents a novel type of nuclear gene-induced variegation mutant. It has also been found that the white tissues of immutans accumulate phytoene, a non-colored C40 carotenoid intermediate. This suggests that immutans controls, either directly or indirectly, the activity of phytoene desaturase (PDS), the enzyme that converts phytoene to zeta-carotene in higher plants. However, im is not the structural gene for PDS. A secondary effect of carotenoid deficiency, both in immutans and in wild-type plants treated with a herbicide that blocks carotenoid synthesis, is an increase in acid ribonuclease activity in white tissue. It is concluded that the novel variegation generated by the immutans mutation should offer great insight into the complex circuitry that regulates nuclear\u2014organelle interactions.", "date": " 1994 ", "authors": ["Carolyn M.

As predicted by the model, single-entry measurements provide narrower distributions than the multiple-entry measurements, since the former are affected by both waveguides and scattering and the latter are affected primarily by waveguides. Measurements at different retinal eccentricities and at two different wavelengths are consistent with the model.

Methods:  Optical coherence tomography images of the macula were obtained in 51 eyes of 44 patients with selected macular diseases. Imaging is performed in a manner compatible with slit-lamp indirect biomicroscopy so that high-resolution optical tomography may be accomplished simultaneously with normal ophthalmic examination.

These patterns provide a psychophysical method for measuring cone spacing within 1.75 deg of the foveal center. In some observers, cone spacing is larger in a horizontal direction than in a vertical direction at any particular location within the fovea. The second experiment shows that the behavior of the moirepatterns is consistent with the triangular packing of foveal cones observed anatomically, and allows the orientation of the cone mosaic to be determined at the foveal center.

Methods  Cones and rods were counted in 27 whole mounted retinas from donors aged 27 to 90 years with macroscopically normal fundi. Photoreceptor topography was analyzed with new graphic and statistical techniques.  Results  Changes in cone density throughout this age span showed no consistent relationship to age or retinal location, and the total number of foveal cones was remarkably stable. In contrast, rod density decreased by 30%, beginning inferior to the fovea in midlife and culminating in an annulus of deepest loss at 0.5 to 3 mm eccentricity by the ninth decade. Space vacated by dying rods was filled in by larger rod inner segments, resulting in a similar rod coverage at all ages. At the temporal equator, cone density declined by 23%, but rods were stable throughout adulthood.  Conclusions  The stability of both rod coverage and rhodopsin content despite decreasing cell number suggests plasticity of the adult rod system and that age-related declines in scotopic sensitivity may be due to postreceptoral factors. There is no evidence for the massive loss of foveal cones required to explain even modest decrements in acuity, consistent with evidence that visual deficits at high photopic levels may be largely due to optical factors.

It is confirmed, by a method giving the absorption curve of unbleached retina, that the retinae of deep-sea fish have golden photosensitive pigments in optical densities so high that they absorb over 90% of blue-green light striking them. Despite the fact that light has passed through all the retinal layers the spectral total density curves correspond closely to those obtained on highly purified retinal extracts.

The losses of light in retinae from which the rod and cone layer has been brushed off, although varying little with wavelength, rise slowly in the near ultra-violet and red from a minimum in the yellow. The edge-fold preparation, useful for studying the dichroism of the retinal rods is described. Using such preparations it is shown that the spectral curves of dichroic difference in density are very close to those of total retinal density and therefore there can be little material absorbing light between 400 and 720 $\\text{m}\\mu $ orientated along the axes of unbleached rods.

Obvious ultrastructural changes are preceded by increases in absorbance below 400 nm. These changes are inhibited by Ar or N2 atmospheres and appear to be due primarily to oxidative damage to the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the membrane lipids. Loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids, formation of malonaldehyde and fluorescent products characteristic of lipid oxidation accompany the spectral alterations. The elevated ultraviolet absorbance can largely be removed from the membranes by gentle extraction of the lipids using phospholipase C and hexane without changing the visible absorbance of rhodopsin.  We have found a large seasonal variation in the endogenous level of \u03b1-tocopherol (vitamin E) in the bovine rod outer segment preparations. For much of the year we find that the rod outer segment membranes contain higher levels of \u03b1-tocopherol than have been previously reported in biological membranes. Rod outer segments which are low in endogenous tocopherol can be protected from oxygen damage by adding exogenous tocopherol. The rod outer segments are extremely susceptible to oxygen damage due to the unusually high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the membrane lipids. The presence of tocopherol inhibits oxygen damage but does not eliminate it. The tocopherol in the rod outer segments is consumed in air, thus complete protection from peroxidation in vitro requires an inert atmosphere as well as high levels of tocopherol.

Retinas fixed with glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde mixtures retained yellow pigments with absorbance spectra very similar to those recorded by MSP in fresh retinas. This allowed the authors to prepare retinal sections for localization of the pigments. The spectrum of the macular pigment in fixed tissue is shifted slightly (about 6 nm) toward longer wavelengths, with maximum absorbance at 460 nm. Two short-wavelength yellow pigments also have been identified, with absorbance maxima at 410 nm ( P410 ) and 435 nm ( P435 ), respectively. All three yellow pigments are present in the fovea. The short-wavelength pigments are detected more easily outside the central foveal region because the macular pigment does not obscure them there. They are especially apparent when the MSP beam is confined to the outer nuclear layer or the inner segment layer of retinal sections. The macular pigment is most dense in the fiber layers (receptor axon layer and inner plexiform layer); its density declines markedly with retinal eccentricity. The maximal absorbance of P410 and P435 is usually lower than that of the macular pigment in the central fovea, but their densities and relative proportions change more gradually with eccentricity. Consequently, their maximal absorbance is higher than that of the macular pigment outside the foveal center. The P410 and P435 pigments may be two different oxidation states of one or more respiratory hemoproteins.

The component chromophores of epidermis and stratum corneum in general determine the attenuation of radiation in these layers, moreso than does optical scattering. Epidermal thickness and melanization are important factors for UV wavelengths less than 300 nm, whereas the attenuation of UVA (320-400 nm) and visible radiation is primarily via melanin. The selective penetration of all optical wavelengths into psoriatic skin can be maximized by application of clear lipophilic liquids, which decrease regular reflectance by a refractive-index matching mechanism. Sensitivity to wavelengths less than 320 nm can be enhanced by prolonged aqueous bathing, which extracts urocanic acid and other diffusible epidermal chromophores. Optical properties of the dermis are modelled using the Kubelka-Munk approach, and calculations of scattering and absorption coefficients are presented. This simple approach allows estimates of the penetration of radiation in vivo using noninvasive measurements of cutaneous spectral remittance (diffuse reflectance). Although the blood chromophores Hb, HbO2, and bilirubin determine dermal absorption of wavelengths longer than 320 nm, scattering by collagen fibers largely determines the depths to which these wavelengths penetrate the dermis, and profoundly modifies skin colors. An optical \"window\" exists between 600 and 1300 nm, which offers the possibility of treating large tissue volumes with certain long-wavelength photosensitizers.

H. Crawford (1933), that light rays entering the eye pupil near its periphery are less efficient in producing the impression of brightness than rays entering centrally, the patch of retina stimulated (the fovea) being the same in both cases. Reasons were put forward in the paper cited for thinking the effect to be retinal in origin, i. e. due to a variation of visual sensitivity with angle of incidence of the light on the retina, rather than the result of a greater absorption of the peripheral rays in transit through the optic media of the eye. Most of the observations were made with white light and, although the absence of any pronounced coloration of the field illuminated by the peripheral ray indicated that the reduction of apparent brightness could not be very different for different colours, it was considered desirable to test this point directly by observations with monochromatic light throughout the spectrum. In Part I of this paper an investigation on these lines is described from which it appears that for the writer\u2019s eye the ratio of the luminous efficiencies of rays entering centrally and peripherally varies systematically to a limited extent in passing through the spectrum. It was also found that within a considerable range of intensity the value of the ratio for a given wave-length is independent of intensity. Since the publication of the original paper, Dziobek (1934) and Wright and Nelson (1936) have both made measurements confirming the existence of a marked variation of luminous efficiency with point of entry.

Each microlens measures not just the total amount of light deposited at that location, but how much light arrives along each ray. By re-sorting the measured rays of light to where they would have terminated in slightly different, synthetic cameras, we can compute sharp photographs focused at different depths. We show that a linear increase in the resolution of images under each microlens results in a linear increase in the sharpness of the refocused photographs. This property allows us to extend the depth of field of the camera without reducing the aperture, enabling shorter exposures and lower image noise. Especially in the macrophotography regime, we demonstrate that we can also compute synthetic photographs from a range of different viewpoints.

We have investigated the moth-eye corneal nipple array of the facet lenses of 19 diurnal butterfly species by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscope, as well as by optical modelling. The nipples appeared to be arranged in domains with almost crystalline, hexagonal packing. The nipple distances were found to vary only slightly, ranging from about 180 to 240 nm, but the nipple heights varied between 0 (papilionids) and 230 nm (a nymphalid), in good agreement with previous work. The nipples create an interface with a gradient refractive index between that of air and the facet lens material, because their distance is distinctly smaller than the wavelength of light. The gradient in the refractive index was deduced from effective medium theory. By dividing the height of the nipple layer into 100 thin slices, an optical multilayer model could be applied to calculate the reflectance of the facet lenses as a function of height, polarization and angle of incidence. The reflectance progressively diminished with increased nipple height. Nipples with a paraboloid shape and height 250 nm, touching each other at the base, virtually completely reduced the reflectance for normally incident light. The calculated dependence of the reflectance on polarization and angle of incidence agreed well with experimental data, underscoring the validity of the modelling. The corneal nipples presumably mainly function to reduce the eye glare of moths that are inactive during the day, so to make them less visible for predators. Moths are probably ancestral to the diurnal butterflies, suggesting that the reduced size of the nipples of most butterfly species indicates a vanishing trait. This effect is extreme in papilionids, which have virtually absent nipples, in line with their highly developed status. A similar evolutionary development can be noticed for the tapetum of the ommatidia of lepidopteran eyes.

Oxidative stress, which refers to cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), has been implicated in many disease processes, especially age-related disorders. ROIs include free radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, and they are often the byproducts of oxygen metabolism. The retina is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress because of its high consumption of oxygen, its high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and its exposure to visible light. In vitro studies have consistently shown that photochemical retinal injury is attributable to oxidative stress and that the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E protect against this type of injury. Furthermore, there is strong evidence suggesting that lipofuscin is derived, at least in part, from oxidatively damaged photoreceptor outer segments and that it is itself a photoreactive substance. However, the relationships between dietary and serum levels of the antioxidant vitamins and age-related macular disease are less clear, although a protective effect of high plasma concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol has been convincingly demonstrated. Macular pigment is also believed to limit retinal oxidative damage by absorbing incoming blue light and/or quenching ROIs. Many putative risk-factors for AMD have been linked to a lack of macular pigment, including female gender, lens density, tobacco use, light iris color, and reduced visual sensitivity. Moreover, the Eye Disease Case-Control Study found that high plasma levels of lutein and zeaxanthin were associated with reduced risk of neovascular AMD. The concept that AMD can be attributed to cumulative oxidative stress is enticing, but remains unproven.

An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities.

Here we develop a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the repeating module of the medulla.

Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations.

In this survey, we focus on outdoor terrestrial OWC links which operate in near IR band. These are widely referred to as free space optical (FSO) communication in the literature. FSO systems are used for high rate communication between two fixed points over distances up to several kilometers. In comparison to radio-frequency (RF) counterparts, FSO links have a very high optical bandwidth available, allowing much higher data rates. They are appealing for a wide range of applications such as metropolitan area network (MAN) extension, local area network (LAN)-to-LAN connectivity, fiber back-up, backhaul for wireless cellular networks, disaster recovery, high definition TV and medical image/video transmission, wireless video surveillance/monitoring, and quantum key distribution among others. Despite the major advantages of FSO technology and variety of its application areas, its widespread use has been hampered by its rather disappointing link reliability particularly in long ranges due to atmospheric turbulence-induced fading and sensitivity to weather conditions. In the last five years or so, there has been a surge of interest in FSO research to address these major technical challenges. Several innovative physical layer concepts, originally introduced in the context of RF systems, such as multiple-input multiple-output communication, cooperative diversity, and adaptive transmission have been recently explored for the design of next generation FSO systems. In this paper, we present an up-to-date survey on FSO communication systems. The first part describes FSO channel models and transmitter/receiver structures.

Cells that incorporated BrdU in the dentate gyrus of adult tree shrews were primarily located in the subgranular zone, had morphological characteristics of granule neuron precursors, and appeared to divide within 24 hr after BrdU injection. Three weeks after BrdU injection, BrdU-labeled cells had neuronal morphology, expressed the neuronal marker neuron specific enolase, and were incorporated into the granule cell layer.

Mathematical analysis of the model yielded several predictions that were confirmed experimentally. Specifically, we found that (1) performance with complex patterns can be predicted by spatiotemporal Fourier analysis that results in the segregation and linear addition in the output for different temporal frequencies; (2) under special conditions, performance depends on the product of adjacent bar amplitudes, offering strong support for the multiplication principle; (3) performance is unaffected by addition of stationary patterns; and (4) addition of homogeneous flicker normally produces no effect but under special conditions reverses perceived direction.

We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light-evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one-dimensional luminance-modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non-linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non-linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non-linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on-off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive.

Regional and local geologic structures are well expressed on the images. In the Vogelkop region of Irian Jaya, the major tectonic elements (Tamrau Mountains, Sorong fault, Kemum block, Bintuni basin, and Lengguru foldbelt) are readily mapped. On the image of the Sorong fault, geomorphic features (offset drainage, shutterridges, aligned notches) provide clear evidence for left-lateral strike-slip displacement.

The generally homoclinal structure of the Central Range is interrupted in the Paniai Lake region by a series of southward directed thrust plates indicated by belts of carbonate terrain (New Guinea Limestone Group) that alternate with belts of clastic terrain (Kembelangan Formation). In the image of eastern Kalimantan, several major foldbelts are clearly expressed.

The resulting land subsidence often combines with ground faulting/fracturing and damage to infrastructure. This study provides the longest Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) survey ever undertaken for the Aguascalientes Valley, aimed to constrain its structurally-controlled subsidence process and the induced risk. 275 ERS-1/2 1996\u20132002, ENVISAT 2003\u20132010 and Sentinel-1 2014\u20132020 C-band SAR images are processed with change detection, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods. Aguascalientes notably expanded over the last four decades, as revealed by Seasat 1978\u00a0L-band SAR, Landsat 1985\u20132010 and Sentinel-2 2020 optical imagery. The observed subsidence pattern involves alluvial/fluvial deposits within the N-S trending graben. Maximum settlement rates are \u221214\u00a0cm/year in 1996, \u221210\u00a0cm/year in 2000\u20132010 and over \u221212\u00a0cm/year in 2015\u20132020. An acceleration (\u22120.70\u00a0cm/year2) is recorded in 2015\u20132020 close to recently developed industrial plants and housing districts. Satellite estimates agree with in-situ observations, static GPS surveying and continuous GPS monitoring data. Rough correlation is found with piezometric level drop rates, whereas aquifer thickness plays a stronger role in the subsidence process. While these outcomes align with the existing literature, this InSAR survey: (i) unveils previously unknown E-W deformation affecting two N-S oriented bands within the valley, with up to ~\u00a0\u00b13\u00a0cm/year in 2015\u20132020 towards its center; (ii) identifies zones of sagging and hogging with horizontal strain (e) of up to 0.05\u20130.1%; (iii) retrieves differential rates reaching 6\u20138\u00a0cm/year and angular distortions (\u03b2) of 1/500 along the Oriente fault; and (iv) investigates the statistical distribution of \u03b2 across field surveyed faults and fissures, and marks areas with potentially yet-unmapped ground discontinuities. A new surface faulting risk matrix embedding \u03b2 and e is therefore proposed to estimate subsidence impact on properties and population. Given its scale-dependency, the risk assessment provides a lower bound to the percentage of urban areas at risk within the Aguascalientes state: at least 2% of the urban areas were at high and very high risk in 2003\u20132010 (involving ~12,000 properties and ~39,000 inhabitants), but this increased to 6% in 2015\u20132020 (~25,600 properties, ~85,200 inhabitants).

It has been imaged twice by each of the Cassini imaging systems (Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) in 2004 and 2005, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) in 2007 and 2009 and RADAR in 2009 and 2010). We compile a geomorphological map and derive a \u201chydrogeological\u201d interpretation of Ontario Lacus, based on a joint analysis of ISS, VIMS and RADAR SAR datasets, along with the T49 altimetric profile acquired in December 2008. The morphologies observed on Ontario Lacus are compared to landforms of a semi-arid terrestrial analog, which resembles Titan\u2019s lakes: the Etosha Pan, located in the Owambo Basin (Namibia). The Etosha Pan is a flat-floored depression formed by dissolution, under semi-arid conditions, of a surface evaporitic layer (calcretes) controlled by groundwater vertical motions. We infer that Ontario Lacus is an extremely flat and shallow depression lying in an alluvial plain surrounded by small mountain ranges under climatic conditions similar to those of terrestrial semi-arid regions. Channels are seen in the southern part of Ontario Lacus in VIMS and RADAR data, acquired at a 2-years time interval. Their constancy in location with time implies that the southern portion of the depression is probably not fully covered by a liquid layer at the time of the observations, and that they most probably run on the floor of the depression. A shallow layer of surface liquids, corresponding to the darkest portions of the RADAR images, would thus cover about 53% of the surface area of the depression, of which almost 70% is located in its northern part. These liquid-covered parts of the depression, where liquid ethane was previously identified, are interpreted as topographic lows where the \u201calkanofer\u201d raises above the depression floor. The rest of the depression, and mostly its southern part, is interpreted as a flat and smooth exposed floor, likely composed of a thick and liquid-saturated coating of photon-absorbing materials in the infrared. This hypothesis could explain its dark appearance both in the infrared and radar data and the persistence of channels seen on the depression floor over the time. Shorelines are observed on the border of Ontario Lacus suggesting past high-stand levels of the alkanofer table. The analogy with the Etosha Pan suggests that Ontario Lacus\u2019 depression developed at the expense of a soluble layer covering the region. Dissolution of this layer would be controlled by vertical motions of the alkanofer table over the time. During flooding events, liquid hydrocarbons covering the depression floor would dissolve the surface layer, increasing progressively the diameter of the depression on geological timescales. During drought episodes, liquid hydrocarbons of the underground alkanofer would evaporate, leading to crystallization of \u201cevaporites\u201d in the pores and at the surface of the substratum, and to the formation of the regional soluble layer. The presence of specific landforms (lunette dunes or evaporites) is compatible with such evaporitic regional settings. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the surface soluble layer might have formed by accumulation on the ground of soluble compounds formed in the atmosphere.", "date": " 2012 ", "authors": ["T.

The first objective is generally impossible on Earth, but is possible on the moon because of the very low EM attenuation found in lunar rocks. A three-wavelength synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) operating at 60 m, 20 m, and 2 m (5, 15, and 150 MHz) was designed to attain these objectives. The design choices reflected a balance of scientific requirements versus Apollo mission and hard-ware constraints. The most difficult choice was that of wavelength, since longer wavelengths have the potential for deeper subsurface penetration at the expense of depth resolution. Shorter wavelengths enhance the ability to generate surface images and accurate profiles. The sounding requirement led to a system requirement for large dynamic range and precise sidelobe control. The radar data from the lunar mission were recorded on photographic film in a conventional SAR format, and were returned to Earth for processing. A combination of optical and digital processing and exploitation techniques was applied to the scientific interpretation of the data.

For each frequency band, the contrast is defined as the ratio of the bandpass-filtered image at the frequency to the low-pass image filtered to an octave below the same frequency (local luminance mean).

Reservoir and trap are provided by highly porous and permeable Miocene reef rocks, which have yielded oil at rates of up to 32,000 bbl per day from individual wells. The Salawati basin is a structural-stratigraphic basin containing more than 15,000 ft (4,600 m) of marine Tertiary sedimentary deposits. The basin is bounded on the north by the Sorong fault zone which separates the Australian continental plate from the Pacific oceanic plate. Basin development was initiated in the Miocene when local downwarping and increased water depths resulted in the deposition of a basinal limestone and shale sequence in the area. Toward the east and south margins of the basin these sediments are replaced by shallow-water carbonate rocks which form a well-defined shelf and associated shelf margin. The productive reef belt is just basinward of the shelf and shelf-margin area. The reefs, which reach heights in excess of 1,600 ft (490 m), range in areal extent from 2 to 48 sq mi (5 to 124 sq km). Porosities within the reefal carbonate rocks are as much as 43 percent and average 20 to 30 percent. Late Pliocene-Pleistocene normal faults which cut many of the reefs, combined with postreef structural tilt, have modified considerably the original configuration of the reefs and the associated oil accumulations. The knowledge gained from the current exploration program concerning reef morphology, porosity variations, tectonic history, and other factors which control the oil accumulations should expedite future exploration efforts in the basin.", "date": " 1976 ", "authors": ["Richard R.

Notable features include a circular structure 30 km in diameter, thought to be a cryogenic dome. This may be volcanic, which could explain how the methane in Titan's atmosphere is replenished. Titan is the only satellite in our Solar System with a dense atmosphere. The surface pressure is 1.5\u2009bar (ref. 1) and, similar to the Earth, N2 is the main component of the atmosphere. Methane is the second most important component2, but it is photodissociated on a timescale of 107\u2009years (ref. 3). This short timescale has led to the suggestion that Titan may possess a surface or subsurface reservoir of hydrocarbons4,5 to replenish the atmosphere. Here we report near-infrared images of Titan obtained on 26 October 2004 by the Cassini spacecraft. The images show that a widespread methane ocean does not exist; subtle albedo variations instead suggest topographical variations, as would be expected for a more solid (perhaps icy) surface.

VI--The role of contrast in low vision.", "abstract": "Abstract   The effect of contrast on reading performance was measured in 19 low-vision observers with a wide range of visual disorders and degrees of vision loss. The observers read text composed of 6 deg letters, ranging in contrast from 0.96 down to contrast threshold for reading. Reading performance was characterized by two parameters:peak reading rate is the reading rate at maximum contrast, andcritical contrast is the contrast at which reading rate drops to half its maximum value. Peak reading rates were lower in observers with central field loss than in observers with intact central vision. In 16 of 19 cases, critical contrasts were higher for low-vision observers than for normal observers (averaging 3.9 times higher), indicating a decreased tolerance to contrast reduction. Values of critical contrast were closely linked to contrast sensitivity for letters (r = 0.87), but did not vary systematically with type of vision loss. Five observers read white-on-black text faster than black-on-white at both high and low contrasts. Four of the five had cloudy ocular media. We attribute this contrast polarity effect to abnormal light scatter in eyes with cloudy media. We examined the hypothesis that our low-vision observers' deviation from normal performance could be characterized (1) by a contrast scaling factor representing an attenuation of effective contrast and (2) that this scale factor could be identified with reduced contrast sensitivity. Such a description provided a good account for subjects with cloudy ocular media, where contrast attenuation results from intraocular light scatter. It provided a first order, but incomplete account for subjects with field loss where contrast attenuation is related to contrast sensitivity losses due to neural factors.", "date": " 1989 ", "authors": ["Gary S.

We have measured quantum efficiency for detecting a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns using foveal vision in bright light. The best stimulus found so far is a small, briefly exposed circular patch of sinusoidal grating having a spatial frequency of approximately 7 c deg-1, drifting at approximately 4 Hz.

In the first part of this paper optimal distance transformations are developed. Local neighborhoods of sizes up to 7\u00d77 pixels are used. First real-valued distance transformations are considered, and then the best integer approximations of them are computed. A new distance transformation is presented, that is easily computed and has a maximal error of about 2%. In the second part of the paper six different distance transformations, both old and new, are used for a few different applications. These applications show both that the choice of distance transformation is important, and that any of the six transformations may be the right choice.", "date": " 1988 ", "authors": ["Gunilla Borgefors"], "related_topics": ["euclidean distance", "transformation (function)", "pixel", "feature (computer vision)", "digital image", "integer (computer science)", "binary number", "image (mathematics)", "algorithm", "computer science"], "citation_count": "2,757", "reference_count": "0", "references": ["1987411288", "2896809075"]}, {"id": "1593939129", "title": "Random Sets and Integral Geometry", "abstract": null, "date": " 1976 ", "authors": ["G.

Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated.

However, the conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing the forward input-output transform. Instead, in this work we present the mathematics of such cascades beyond the forward transform, namely the Jacobian matrices and the inverse. The fundamental reason for this analytical treatment is that it offers useful analytical insight into the psychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For instance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (volume of the discrimination regions) and the adaptation of the receptive fields can be identified in the expression of the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the stimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The Jacobian w.r.t. the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact in the response, and hence their relative relevance. The analytic inverse implies conditions for the response and model parameters to ensure appropriate decoding. From the experimental and applied perspective, (a) the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus is necessary in new experimental methods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometrical properties, (b) the Jacobian matrices w.r.t. the parameters are convenient to learn the model from classical experiments or alternative goal optimization, and (c) the inverse is a promising model-based alternative to blind machine-learning methods for neural decoding that do not include meaningful biological information. The theory is checked by building and testing a vision model that actually follows a modular Linear+Nonlinear program. Our illustrative derivable and invertible model consists of a cascade of modules that account for brightness, contrast, energy masking, and wavelet masking. To stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of the canonical Divisive Normalization modules are substituted by equivalent modules such as the Wilson-Cowan interaction model (at the V1 cortex) or a tone-mapping model (at the retina).", "date": " 2018 ", "authors": ["M.

We found that correlations estimated without taking phylogeny into account were often quite poor and never substantially better than those produced by the other tested methods. In contrast, most PCMs performed quite well even when their assumptions were violated. Felsenstein's independent contrasts (FIC) method gave the best performance in many cases, even when weak constraints had been acting throughout phenotypic evolution.

SuperIso Relic  is an extension of the  SuperIso  program which adds to the flavor observables of  SuperIso  the computation of all possible annihilation and coannihilation processes of the LSP which are required for the relic density calculation. All amplitudes have been generated at the tree level with  FeynArts / FormCalc , and widths of the Higgs bosons are computed with  FeynHiggs  at the two-loop level.  SuperIso Relic  also provides the possibility to modify the assumptions of the cosmological model, and to study their consequences on the relic density.

Solution method: SuperIso Relic uses a SUSY Les Houches Accord file, which can be either generated automatically via a call to SOFTSUSY or ISAJET, or provided by the user. This file contains the masses and couplings of the supersymmetric particles. SuperIso Relic then computes the lightest supersymmetric particle relic density as well as the most constraining flavor physics observables. To do so, it calculates first the widths of the Higgs bosons with FeynHiggs, and then it evaluates the squared amplitudes of the diagrams needed for the relic density calculation. These thousands of diagrams have been previously generated with the FeynArts/FormCalc package. SuperIso Relic is able to perform the calculations in different supersymmetry breaking scenarios, such as mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and GMSB.

This paper extends fundamental morphological operations to the setting of matrices, in the literature sometimes referred to as tensors despite the fact that matrices are only rank two tensors. The goal of this paper is to introduce and explore two approaches to mathematical morphology for matrix-valued data: one is based on a partial ordering, the other utilises nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We start by presenting definitions for the maximum and minimum of a set of symmetric matrices since these notions are the cornerstones of the morphological operations. Our first approach is based on the Loewner ordering for symmetric matrices, and is in contrast to the unsatisfactory component-wise techniques. The notions of maximum and minimum deduced from the Loewner ordering satisfy desirable properties such as rotation invariance, preservation of positive semidefiniteness, and continuous dependence on the input data. These properties are also shared by the dilation and erosion processes governed by a novel nonlinear system of PDEs we are proposing for our second approach to morphology on matrix data. These PDEs are a suitable counterpart of the nonlinear equations known from scalar continuous-scale morphology. Both approaches incorporate information simultaneously from all matrix channels rather than treating them independently. In experiments on artificial and real medical positive semidefinite matrix-valued images we contrast the resulting notions of erosion, dilation, opening, closing, top hats, morphological derivatives, and shock filters stemming from these two alternatives.

Previously published techniques for specifying and animating deformations are either limited in their domain or ill-suited for interactive editing and visualization, because the effects of alterations performed by the animator on the model's parameters may not always be anticipated, and because realtime animation may only be produced by visualizing precomputed sequences of 3D frames obtained by a slow process and require vast amounts of storage. To support an interactive environment for animation design, we have developed a new, simple, and efficient animation primitive: a Parameterized Interpolating Polyhedron (PIP). PIPs are easily specified and edited by providing their initial and final shapes, which may be any polyhedra, and need not have corresponding boundary elements, nor be convex. PIPs may be efficiently animated on standard graphic hardware because a PIP is a smoothly varying family of polyhedra bounded by faces that evolve with time. The faces have constant orientations and vertices that each move on a straight line between a vertex of the initial shape and a vertex of the final one. The cost of recalculating the time dependent information of a PIP is small in comparison to the display cost. We provide simple and efficient algorithms, based on Minkowski sum operations, for computing PIPs. When both the initial and final shapes are convex, the resulting faces are the true boundary of the deforming object, otherwise subsets of the resulting faces may lie inside the object. In both cases, correct images are automatically generated using standard depth-buffer hardware. The tools we have developed are convenient for interactively designing animation sequences that show the metamorphosis of 3D shapes. They may also be used to simulate the geometric effect of a variety of manufacturing operations, and for interactively selecting the optimal compromise between two or more shapes.

Part I of this paper, developed hereafter, is devoted to the description of a theory leading to a unification of the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively (part II will deal with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, which will be illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data). In this first part, we review the previous approaches to the grey-level HMT, especially the supremal one of Ronse, and the integral one of Soille; the latter was defined only for flat structuring elements (SEs), but it can be generalized to non-flat ones. We present a unified theory of the grey-level HMT, which is decomposed into two steps. First a fitting associates to each point the set of grey-levels for which the SEs can be fitted to the image; as in Soille's approach, this fitting step can be constrained.

Previously published techniques for specifying and animating deformations are either limited in their domain or ill-suited for interactive editing and visualization, because the effects of alterations performed by the animator on the model's parameters may not always be anticipated, and because realtime animation may only be produced by visualizing precomputed sequences of 3D frames obtained by a slow process and require vast amounts of storage. To support an interactive environment for animation design, we have developed a new, simple, and efficient animation primitive: a Parameterized Interpolating Polyhedron (PIP). PIPs are easily specified and edited by providing their initial and final shapes, which may be any polyhedra, and need not have corresponding boundary elements, nor be convex. PIPs may be efficiently animated on standard graphic hardware because a PIP is a smoothly varying family of polyhedra bounded by faces that evolve with time. The faces have constant orientations and vertices that each move on a straight line between a vertex of the initial shape and a vertex of the final one. The cost of recalculating the time dependent information of a PIP is small in comparison to the display cost. We provide simple and efficient algorithms, based on Minkowski sum operations, for computing PIPs. When both the initial and final shapes are convex, the resulting faces are the true boundary of the deforming object, otherwise subsets of the resulting faces may lie inside the object. In both cases, correct images are automatically generated using standard depth-buffer hardware. The tools we have developed are convenient for interactively designing animation sequences that show the metamorphosis of 3D shapes. They may also be used to simulate the geometric effect of a variety of manufacturing operations, and for interactively selecting the optimal compromise between two or more shapes. They have been integrated in the LAMBADA design and inspection environment for animated assemblies, where deformations and rigid-body motions may be easily combined and synchronized using a hierarchical representation.", "date": " 1992 ", "authors": ["Anil Kaul", "Jarek Rossignac"], "related_topics": ["animation", "geometric shape", "polyhedron", "visualization", "vertex (geometry)", "minkowski addition", "representation (mathematics)", "software", "computer graphics (images)", "computer vision", "computer science", "artificial intelligence"], "citation_count": "293", "reference_count": "26", "references": ["2164741953", "1989871863", "2096619076", "2163178194", "2100185791", "3006964082", "1593939129", "2797204481", "2293545866", "2098449997", "2113069029"]}, {"id": "2130927162", "title": "Wolbachia infection frequencies in insects: evidence of a global equilibrium?", "abstract": "Wolbachia are a group of cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that cause reproduction alterations in arthropods, including parthenogenesis, reproductive incompatibility, feminization of genetic males and male killing.

This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i.

A now rich and complex body of work develops nearly or exactly minimax estimators for an array of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have rarely moved into practice, for a variety of reasons-among them being similarity to known methods, computational intractability and lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a method for curve estimation based on n noisy data: translate the empirical wavelet coefficients towards the origin by an amount \u221a(2 log n) /\u221an. The proposal differs from those in current use, is computationally practical and is spatially adaptive; it thus avoids several of the previous objections. Further, the method is nearly minimax both for a wide variety of loss functions-pointwise error, global error measured in L p -norms, pointwise and global error in estimation of derivatives-and for a wide range of smoothness classes, including standard Holder and Sobolev classes, and bounded variation. This is a much broader near optimality than anything previously proposed: we draw loose parallels with near optimality in robustness and also with the broad near eigenfunction properties of wavelets themselves.

Our goal has been to construct comprehensive models that take into account the majority of factors known to influence dengue epidemiology. The models have an orientation toward site-specific data and are designed to be used by operational programs as well as researchers. The first model, the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation model (CIMSiM), a weather-driven dynamic life-table model of container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, provides inputs to the transmission model, the dengue simulation model (DENSiM); a description and validation of the entomology model was published previously. The basis of the transmission model is the simulation of a human population growing in response to country- and age-specific birth and death rates. An accounting of individual serologies is maintained by type of dengue virus, reflecting infection and birth to seropositive mothers. Daily estimates of adult mosquito survival, gonotrophic development, and the weight and number of emerging females from the CIMSiM are used to create the biting mosquito population in the DENSiM. The survival and emergence values determine the size of the population while the rate of gonotrophic development and female weight estimates influence biting frequency. Temperature and titer of virus in the human influences the extrinsic incubation period; titer may also influence the probability of transfer of virus from human to mosquito. The infection model within the DENSiM accounts for the development of virus within individuals and its passage between both populations. As in the case of the CIMSiM, the specific values used for any particular phenomenon are on menus where they can be readily changed. It is possible to simulate concurrent epidemics involving different serotypes. To provide a modicum of validation and to demonstrate the parameterization process for a specific location, we compare simulation results with reports on the nature of epidemics and seroprevalence of antibody in Honduras in low-lying coastal urbanizations and Tegucigalpa following the initial introduction of dengue-1 in 1978 into Central America. We conclude with some additional examples of simulation results to give an indication of the types of questions that can be investigated with the models.", "date": " 1995 ", "authors": ["Dana A.

(1) From the 1960s to 1980s, human infections were found across Africa and Asia, typically accompanied by mild illness. The first large outbreak of disease caused by Zika infection was reported from the island of Yap (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007, as the virus moved from south-east Asia across the Pacific. During an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014, Guillain-Barre syndrome was linked to Zika infection and cases of microcephaly in newborn children were also retrospectively linked to this outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) received the first reports of locally-transmitted infection from Brazil in May 2015. In July 2015, health ministry officials from Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. In October 2015, WHO received reports from Brazil of microcephaly in babies whose mothers had been exposed to Zika during pregnancy. At this time, there was no proof of a causal link between Zika infection and these neurological complications. In February 2016, as infection moved rapidly through the range occupied by Aedes mosquitos in the Americas, WHO declared that Zika infection associated with microcephaly and other neurological disorders constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). By the start of February 2016, local transmission of Zika infection had been reported from more than 20 countries and territories in the Americas and an outbreak numbering thousands of cases was under way in Cabo Verde in western Africa. Beyond the range of its mosquito vectors, Zika virus infections are expected to be carried worldwide by people as they travel and be transmitted by travellers to sexual partners who have not been to places where the virus is endemic. Methods To illustrate the spread of Zika virus and associated neurological complications, we did a literature search in PubMed using \"Zika\" and \"ZIKV\" as the search terms and cross-checked our findings for completeness against other published reviews. (2, 3) In addition, we drew on formal notifications to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR), (4) which are archived in the WHO Event Information Site (EIS). EIS contains information about public health events of potential international concern notified to WHO as required by the IHR. EIS notifications sometimes contain confidential patient information and therefore are not publicly available. Other details of specific events can be provided by the authors on request. Results The first reported case of Zika virus dates to 1947 when the virus was isolated in samples taken from a captive sentinel rhesus monkey by scientists conducting routine surveillance for yellow fever in the Zika forest of Uganda. (1) The virus was recovered from Aedes (Stegomyia) africanus, caught on a tree platform in the forest. (1) Laboratory infection experiments showed the virus to be neurotropic in mice. (5) The timeline presented in this paper includes numerous serological surveys that purportedly detected antibodies to Zika virus in the 1950s and 1960s in Africa and Asia. Because serological (antibody detection) tests for Zika cross-react with antibodies stimulated by other viral infections, the presence of Zika virus is ideally confirmed by the detection of viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or by virus isolation. A chronological map of the presence of Zika in those countries for which there is evidence of autochthonous transmission by mosquitos is presented in Fig. 1. The map excludes the many countries from which imported Zika infections have been reported.

It is further found that the size of the invariant group increases as the range of species is narrowed. Extrapolation suggests that less than 10% of the codons in a given mammalian cytochrome c gene are capable of accepting a mutation.

We define this restricted group as the concomitantly variable codons.

We report the results of long-term follow-up interim analyses and integrated efficacy analyses. METHODS We are assessing the incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue as a surrogate safety end point during follow-up in years 3 to 6 of two phase 3 trials, CYD14 and CYD15, and a phase 2b trial, CYD23/57. We estimated vaccine efficacy using pooled data from the first 25 months of CYD14 and CYD15. RESULTS Follow-up data were available for 10,165 of 10,275 participants (99%) in CYD14 and 19,898 of 20,869 participants (95%) in CYD15. Data were available for 3203 of the 4002 participants (80%) in the CYD23 trial included in CYD57. During year 3 in the CYD14, CYD15, and CYD57 trials combined, hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue occurred in 65 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 39 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled relative risks of hospitalization for dengue were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.24) among all participants, 1.58 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.02) among those under the age of 9 years, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) among those 9 years of age or older. During year 3, hospitalization for severe dengue, as defined by the independent data monitoring committee criteria, occurred in 18 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 6 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled rates of efficacy for symptomatic dengue during the first 25 months were 60.3% (95% CI, 55.7 to 64.5) for all participants, 65.6% (95% CI, 60.7 to 69.9) for those 9 years of age or older, and 44.6% (95% CI, 31.6 to 55.0) for those younger than 9 years of age. CONCLUSIONS Although the unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue in year 3 among children younger than 9 years of age needs to be carefully monitored during long-term follow-up, the risk among children 2 to 16 years of age was lower in the vaccine group than in the control group.

The bovine and human mitochondrial transfer RNA genes exhibit more interspecies variation than do their cytoplasmic counterparts, with the \u201cT\u03a8C\u201d loop being the most variable part of the molecule. The bovine 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA genes, when compared with those from human mitochondrial DNA, show conserved features that are consistent with proposed secondary structure models for the ribosomal RNAs. Unlike the pattern of moderate-to-high homology between the bovine and human mitochondrial DNAs found over most of the genome, the DNA sequence in the bovine D-loop region is only slightly homologous to the corresponding region in the human mitochondrial genome.

The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently.

Ten subgroups were delineated in homology group I. Species in each subgroup either had high homology with a particular reference species or a similar pattern of homologies to all of the reference organisms. The eleven species in rRNA homology group II had 69% or greater homology to C. lituseburense. Species in groups I and II had intergroup homologies of 20 to 40%. The six species in group III had very low homologies with groups I and II. Negligible homology also resulted when five of the species were tested against the sixth, C. ramosum. The five species having DNA with 41 to 45% GC were C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. indolis, C. barkeri and C. oroticum.

The correlation of lipid composition with taxonomic classification showed that qualitative fatty acid analyses could be used to differentiate between various organisms. Lipids are most simply defined as the natural products that may be isolated from biological materials by extraction with organic solvents and that are usually insoluble in water. The lipids commonly found in bacteria are amphiphatic molecules, that is, they consist of distinct polar and apolar regions. The chemical composition of many bacterial components, including lipids, can be affected by a variety of external factors, such as temperature of growth, substrate composition, pH of environment, and time of harvesting.

We introduce differential information in points coordinates: this allows us to match locally similar points. Then, we show how principal frames and curvatures are transformed by an affine transformation. Finally, we introduce this differential information in a global criterion minimized by extended Kalman filtering in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm. \u2022Third, we locally deform the surface. Instead of computing a global affine transformation, we attach to each point a local affine transformation varying smoothly along the surface. We call this deformation a locally affine deformation.

The two principal curvatures (taken as a pair) are more informative, but one would prefer a single shape indicator rather than a pair of numbers. Moreover, the shape indicator should preferably be independent of the size i.e. the amount of curvature, as distinct from the type of curvature. We propose two novel measures of local shape, the \u2018curvedness\u2019 and the \u2018shape index\u2019. The curvedness is a positive number that specifies the amount of curvature, whereas the shape index is a number in the range [\u22121, +1] and is scale invariant. The shape index captures the intuitive notion of \u2018local shape\u2019 particularly well. The shape index can be mapped upon an intuitively natural colour scale. Two complementary shapes (like stamp and mould) map to complementary hues. The symmetrical saddle (which is very special because it is self-complementary) maps to white.

Our synthetic approach was to introduce various substituents (amino, alkoxy and alkynyl groups) into the 2-, 6-, or 8-positions of the purine ring. The starting compounds for each series of derivatives were respectively: 2-iodo-9-ethyladenine ( 9 ), obtained from 2-amino-6-chloropurine ( 5 ); 9-ethyl-6-iodo-9 H -purine ( 11 ), 8-bromo-9-ethyl-adenine ( 3 ) and 8-bromo-9-ethyl-6-iodo-9 H -purine ( 13 ), obtained from 9-ethyl-adenine ( 2 ). The synthesized compounds were tested in in vitro radioligand binding assays at A 1 , A 2A , and A 3  human adenosine receptor subtypes. Due to the lack of a suitable radioligand the affinity of the 9-ethyladenine derivatives at A 2B  adenosine receptors was determined in adenylyl cyclase experiments. In general, the series of 9-ethylpurine derivatives exhibited a similar pharmacological profile at A 1  and A 2A  receptors whereas some differences were found for the A 3  and the A 2B  subtypes. 8-Bromo-9-ethyladenine ( 3 ) showed higher affinity for all receptors in comparison to the parent compound  2 , and the highest affinity in the series for the A 2A  and A 2B  subtypes ( K  i =0.052 and 0.84\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). Analyzing the different substituents, a phenethoxy group in 2-position ( 10a ) gave the highest A 2A  versus A 2B  selectivity (near 400-fold), whereas a phenethylamino group in 2- and 6-position ( 10b  and  12b , respectively) improved the affinity at A 2B  receptors, compared to the parent compound  2 .

A functional analysis of structural clusters position along the chromosomes co-localizes them with genes involved in several key cellular processes like immune systems, sensory systems, signal transduction and development. Immune systems diseases, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by genes that are especially well organized around structural clusters of miRNAs. Target genes functional analysis strongly supports a regulatory role of most predicted miRNAs and, notably, a strong involvement of predicted miRNAs in the regulation of cancer pathways. This analysis provides new fundamental insights on the genomic organization of miRNAs in human chromosomes.", "date": " 2013 ", "authors": ["Anthony Mathelier", "Alessandra Carbone"], "related_topics": ["human genome", "deep sequencing", "genomic organization", "3' untranslated regions", "algorithms"], "citation_count": "62", "reference_count": "68", "references": []}, {"id": "2007153649", "title": "Multiresolution elastic matching", "abstract": "Matching of locally variant data to an explicit 3-dimensional pictorial model is developed for X-ray computed tomography scans of the human brain, where the model is a voxel representation of an anatomical human brain atlas.

Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.  These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,  and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.", "date": " 1992 ", "authors": ["Lisa Gottesfeld Brown"], "related_topics": ["image registration", "template matching", "image processing"], "citation_count": "6,652", "reference_count": "82", "references": []}, {"id": "2063549868", "title": "Object modelling by registration of multiple range images", "abstract": "We study the problem of creating a complete model of a physical object.

In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views.

A bi-secondary structure is represented by drawing its respective secondary structures in the upper and lower half-plane. An RNA secondary structure has a loop decomposition, where a loop corresponds to a boundary component, regarding the secondary structure as an orientable fatgraph. The loop-decomposition of secondary structures facilitates the computation of its free energy and any two loops intersect either trivially or in exactly two vertices. In bi-secondary structures the intersection of loops is more complex and is of importance in current algorithmic work in bio-informatics and evolutionary optimization. We shall construct a simplicial complex capturing the intersections of loops and compute its homology. We prove that only the zeroth and second homology groups are nontrivial and furthermore show that the second homology group is free.

In comparison, Watson-Crick nearest-neighbor increments range from -0. 58 (TA/AT) to -2.24 (GC/CG) kcal/mol. Hence, in some cases, a dangling end contributes as much to duplex stability as a Watson-Crick A-T base pair. The implications of these results for DNA probe design are discussed.

Y+ can be isolated easily in pure form from oligonucleotides, tRNAPheYeast, or even unfractionated tRNAyeast (not tRNAcoli) by mild acid treatment and subsequent extraction into chloroform.\r\n\r\n2\r\ntRNAPheHCl and tRNAPhe have very similar molecular sizes and shapes since their Sephadex elution profiles were overlapping. The facile separation of tRNAPhe and tRNAPheHCl by counter current distribution, on columns of methylated albumin on Kieselgur or benzoylated DEAE-celluose is due, at least in part, to the removal of a hydrophobic residue from an exposed region of the tRNAPhe.\r\n\r\n3\r\ntRNAPheHCl can be charged with Phe to the same extent as tRNAPhe. Since also the Michaelis constant of phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase is the same for both tRNAs (1.5\u00d710\u22127 M) and the maximal velocity of charging is decreased by only one third in tRNAPheHCl, it can be concluded, that Y and probably the whole anticodon loop are not essential parts of the synthetase recognition region of tRNAPhe in homologous charging reactions.\r\n\r\n4\r\nIt was found that tRNAPheHCl and tRNAPhe from which the \u2013CpCpA endgroups had been removed do not differ in their acceptor capacities for CTP and ATP.\r\n\r\n5\r\nIn the ribosome systems, Phe-tRNAPheHCl, does not bind to poly (U) or other polynucleotides and does not transfer its amino acid onto growing peptide chains. The complete loss of codon recognition is attributed largely to a change in the conformation of the anticodon loop. The ultraviolet spectra of an Y-containing hexanucleotide and of its acid conversion products are in agreement with the notion of a strong interaction between Y+ and its neighbouring bases, as are the rate differences in the liberation of Y+ from Y [1.5 times faster] and the hexanucleotide, respectively.\r\n\r\n6\r\nThe rate of tRNAPheHCl formation, as measured by methylated albumin on Kieselgur-column chromatography and binding assays, is the same as the rate of Y+-liberation from the hexanucleotide. The acid induced conversion of tRNAPhe to tRNAPheHCl is a completely selective reaction affecting Y as the only nucleoside of tRNAPhe.", "date": " 1968 ", "authors": ["R. Thiebe", "H. G.

Keeping the hypothesis of triplet pairings between primitive RNA molecules at the origin of the code, this work systematically examines complete codon-anticodon interaction matrices assuming distinct pairing options at each position of the triplet duplexes. Application of these principles suggests that a 27-codon precursor having a reasonable coding capacity for short peptide synthesis could have started with primitive RNA molecules able to form two distinct pairs with different free energies between a single purine and two pyrimidines (such as G with C and U). Conservation of the same pairing options at positions 1 and 2 of codons at the arrival of a second purine with distinct pairing preferences (such as A) generated a 64-codon intermediate code made of interrelated pairs or groups of codons (designated here as intricacy). The numerous traces of this hypothetical scheme that are visible in the standard and variant forms of the modern code demonstrate without ambiguity that the ancestral codon-anticodon duplexes required high energetic pairings at their central position (Watson-Crick) but tolerated less energetic pairings at the first codon position (G \u2022 U type). Combined with the sequential appearance of the nucleobases, the predicted codon intricacy allows a stepwise reconstruction of the evolution of the coding repertoire, by simple a posteriori comparison to the modern code. This reconstruction reveals a remarkable internal coherence in terms of amino acids and tRNA synthetases recruitment. The code started with a group of amino acids (Ala, Gly, Pro, Ser and Thr) that are now all activated by class II tRNA synthetases before reaching an intermediate period during which up to 14 distinct amino acids could be encoded by a full set of intricated codons.

As a result, it can be employed to separate proteins with SCX and HIC modes, respectively. The resolution and selectivity of the dual-function stationary phase were evaluated under both HIC and SCX modes with standard proteins and can be comparable to that of conventional IEC and HIC columns. More than 96% of mass and bioactivity recoveries of proteins can be achieved in both HIC and SCX modes, respectively. The results indicated that the novel dual-function column could replace two individual SCX and HIC columns for protein separation. Mixed retention mechanism of proteins on this dual-function column based on stoichiometric displacement theory (SDT) in LC was investigated to find the optimal balance of the magnitude of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between protein and the ligand on the silica surface in order to obtain high resolution and selectivity for protein separation. In addition, the effects of the hydrophobicity of the ligand of the dual-function packings and pH of the mobile phase used on protein separation were also investigated in detail. The results show that the ligand with suitable hydrophobicity to match the electrostatic interaction is very important to prepare the dual-function stationary phase, and a better resolution and selectivity can be obtained at pH 6.5 in SCX mode.

In the present paper, tRNAs of the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the relative abundance of purified tRNA molecules was measured on the basis of molecular numbers in cells. A strong correlation between tRNA abundance and codon choice was found for each nuclear gene of yeast, but the correlation was less significant for 2\u03bc plasmid genes. According to the criteria proposed for  E. coli  genes (Ikemura, 1981 b ) the order of codon preference in yeast nuclear genes was predicted based on the abundance of yeast isoaccepting tRNAs and on the nature of the modified nucleotides at their anticodons.

A major determinant of miaA activity is known to be the single-stranded tRNA sequence, A36A37A38, in a stem-loop. tRNA(Trp)(CCA) from either yeast is a Tit1p substrate, but neither is a Mod5p substrate despite the presence of A36A37A38. We show that Tit1p accommodates a broader range of substrates than Mod5p. tRNA(Trp)(CCA) is distinct from Mod5p substrates, which we sort into two classes based on the presence of G at position 34 and other elements. A single substitution of C34 to G converts tRNA(Trp)(CCA) to a Mod5p substrate in vitro and in vivo, consistent with amino acid contacts to G34 in existing Mod5p-tRNA(Cys)(GCA) crystal structures. Mutation of Mod5p in its G34 recognition loop region debilitates it differentially for its G34 (class I) substrates. Multiple alignments reveal that the G34 recognition loop sequence of Mod5p differs significantly from Tit1p, which more resembles human TRIT1 and other DMATases. We show that TRIT1 can also modify tRNA(Trp)(CCA) consistent with broad recognition similar to Tit1p.

Ribosomal RNA seems to stand apart with only a passive participation in information transfer. Its relationship to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is unsettled, one group favoring a \u201cmelting\u201d of mRNA into the ribosome, while others favor separate paths of synthesis from a common pool of mononucleotides. The general mode of biosynthesis of sequence patterns has proven to be a one-by-one addition and the differences of sequence pattern between ribosomal and the template carrying mRNA are difficult to explain. The chapter discusses that the rapid turnover of mRNA was originally thought to be a characteristic of this class of material. Such turnover now seems rather to be a feature of microbial mRNA during rapid growth. It is related to a rapid rate of protein synthesis and the need for fast replacement in view of an apparently rapidly changing mRNA population with a probably sequential translating of DNA into protein synthesis during the growth cycle. Thus mRNA may be defined, as of now, as a sequence-determining template that combines with ribosomes for catalytic functioning in protein synthesis.", "date": " 1963 ", "authors": ["Fritz Lipmann"], "related_topics": ["translational frameshift", "p-bodies", "protein biosynthesis", "ribosome", "rna", "messenger rna", "ribosomal rna", "population", "biochemistry", "biology"], "citation_count": "67", "reference_count": "85", "references": []}, {"id": "1561865504", "title": "Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis in Rat Liver Microsome Fractions", "abstract": "Rat liver microsome fractions contain two general kinds of inhibitors of amino acid incorporation in vitro. The first is derived from lysosomes contaminating the microsome fractions. Lysosomes may be removed from rough vesicles (ribosomes plus endoplasmic membranes) by a density centrifugation technique.  Lysosomal inhibition of incorporation in vitro is much more prominent in normal than in regenerating liver microsomes even though the lysosome content is the same, suggesting that normal lysosomes release their degradative enzymes more readily during incubation. Rough vesicles from normal and regenerating livers are alike in activity, as are the polyribosomes derived therefrom.  The second inhibitor is a heat-labile factor associated with the endoplasmic reticular membrane, which requires oxidized glutathione under certain conditions and which can be reversed by an excess of guanosine triphosphate or sulfhydryl reagents. The inhibitor-sensitive step is the transfer of amino acids from aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to protein.  Enzymes catalyzing the transfer of amino acids from soluble ribonucleic acid to protein are less than half as active (per mg of supernatant protein) in normal as in regenerating liver when tested at limiting concentration and in the absence of GTP. Their activity is equalized in the presence of an excess of GTP.

By 36 hours, beginning reorganization of the rough endoplasmic reticulum was observed in the vicinity of hypertrophic Golgi complexes. This process continued at the 48- and 60-hour intervals, while the hepatocellular lipid progressively decreased. By the 72-hour interval, stratified layers of rough endoplasmic reticulum had reappeared in many parenchymal cells. At 96 and 120 hours after partial hepatectomy, most of the liver cells displayed essentially normal cytoplasmic components, including small glycogen deposits which were interspersed among elements of a slightly prominent smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  Throughout the period of regeneration, hepatocellular nuclei were enlarged and irregular in outline. In many instances, the nucleoplasm exhibited prominent perichromatin and interchromatin granules; and, on occasion, the nuclei contained large chromatin clumps. Nucleoli were also enlarged, frequently were multiple, and often displayed a prominent small granule component.

The peculiarly tenacious binding of the DNA-like RNA to MAK permits its separation from the other nucleic acids during salt elution. MAK columns will differentiate between two forms of DNA-like RNA; one is eluted by the salt gradient and has a high sedimentation velocity (50 s), the other needs more vigorous elution and has a lower modal sedimentation coefficient (16 s). Both types of DNA-like RNA are rapidly synthesized. The kinetics of  32 P incorporation into them are qualitatively consistent with a role for the 50 s moiety as precursor to the 16 s fraction. The 16 s type of DNA-like RNA resembles messenger RNA in rate of synthesis, sedimentation pattern, composition, tenacity of binding to MAK and in the relative amount in the cell, and is, therefore, tentatively identified with it, at least in part.

When normal base-pairing is prevented, by such modification, it is ascribed to the steric effects or to disturbed stacking interactions. Such inhibitory effects are greatly decreased, if the modified nucleoside is a minor component in a heteropolymer, as is likely  in vivo . Another group of derivatives can also form hydrogen bonds with complementary nucleosides, but in these cases, the modification is such that Watson-Crick base-pairing, with either of the two nucleosides, can occur. Thus, in translation, ribosyl-2-aminopurine, nebularin, and 7-deazanebularin can all act as A or G. Changed base-pairing, resulting from modification, is found for inosine, xanthosine, and N 4 -hydroxy- or N 4 -methoxycytidine. These derivatives exemplify classical mutation, resulting from chemical modification. The last class of modified nucleosides includes derivatives that are modified on positions, normally involved in Watson-Crick base pairing, and they were long regarded as lethal modifications\u2014 that is, no base-pairing was assumed to take place even in a heteropolymer.

Each hydrogen bond in DNA consists of a proton shared between two electron lone pairs, and the genetic code is essentially a proton code. The probability of proton transfer in the hydrogen bonds of DNA is further discussed. By using the available charge orders for the \u03c0 electrons of the base pairs, it is shown that the double-well potentials acting on the protons are highly asymmetric. At normal temperature, there is practically no proton transfer above the barrier, explaining the enormous stability of the genetic code. According to quantum mechanics, however, a proton is not a classical particle but a \u201cwave packet,\u201d which may penetrate a potential barrier by means of the \u201ctunnel effect.\u201d Depending on this proton tunneling, there is hence a very small but with time increasing probability that the normal base pairs A-T and G-C may spontaneously go over into the tautomeric pairs A*-T* and G*-C* through a \u201cproton exchange\u201d along the hydrogen bonds. Since the tautomeric bases have another pairing pattern, the proton exchange leads inevitably to errors in the genetic base sequence in the next duplication. The various possibilities suggested for the transcription of the genetic code through the formation of messenger RNA are studied, and the present status of the coding problem in protein synthesis is briefly reviewed.", "date": " 1966 ", "authors": ["Per-Olov Lowdin"], "related_topics": ["quantum biology", "base pair", "proton", "rectangular potential barrier", "lone pair", "tautomer", "dna", "electron", "quantum mechanics", "chemistry"], "citation_count": "461", "reference_count": "188", "references": ["2032619610", "3022006584", "3021489045", "1980825611", "3023696759", "2060528969", "2008365039", "2131535785", "2131826223", "2078229089", "2325115828", "2040756966", "2047174990"]}, {"id": "1826442349", "title": "The highly conserved KEOPS/EKC complex is essential for a universal tRNA modification, t6A", "abstract": "The highly conserved Kinase, Endopeptidase and Other Proteins of small Size (KEOPS)/Endopeptidase-like and Kinase associated to transcribed Chromatin (EKC) protein complex has been implicated in transcription, telomere maintenance and chromosome segregation, but its exact function remains unknown.

Other proposals appeared in the years that followed and gave origin to different theoretical frameworks, or different schools, of biosemiotics. They are: (1) the physical biosemiotics of Howard Pattee and its extension in Darwinian biosemiotics by Howard Pattee and by Terrence Deacon, (2) the zoosemiotics proposed by Thomas Sebeok and its extension in sign biosemiotics developed by Thomas Sebeok and by Jesper Hoffmeyer, (3) the code biosemiotics of Marcello Barbieri and (4) the hermeneutic biosemiotics of Anton Markos. The differences that exist between the schools are a consequence of their different models of semiosis, but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

(1980) Biochemistry 19, 3543], the intrinsic isotope effects on this reaction are fully expressed. Primary deuterium, 13C, and 18O isotope effects in formate and the alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect at C-4 of the nucleotide have been measured for nucleotide substrates with redox potentials varying from -0.320 (NAD) to -0.258 V (acetylpyridine-NAD). As the redox potential gets more positive, the primary deuterium isotope effect increases from 2.2 to 3.1, the primary 13C isotope effect decreases from 1.042 to 1.036, the alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect drops from 1.23 to 1.06, and Vmax decreases. The 18O isotope effects increase from 1.005 to 1.008 per single 18O substitution in formate (these values are dominated by the normal isotope effect on the dehydration of formate during binding; pyridinealdehyde-NAD gives an inverse value, possibly because it is not fully dehydrated during binding). These isotope effects suggest a progression toward earlier transition states as the redox potential of the nucleotide becomes more positive, with NAD having a late and acetyl-pyridine-NAD a nearly symmetrical transition state. By contrast, the I2 oxidation of formate in dimethyl sulfoxide has a very early transition state (13k = 1.0154; Dk = 2.2; 18k = 0.9938), which becomes later as the proportion of water in the solvent increases (13k = 1.0265 in 40% dimethyl sulfoxide and 1.0362 in water). alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effects with formate dehydrogenase are decreased halfway to the equilibrium isotope effect when deuterated formate is the substrate, showing that the bending motion of the secondary hydrogen is coupled to hydride transfer in the transition state and that tunneling of the two hydrogens is involved. The 15N isotope effect of 1.07 for NAD labeled at N-1 of the nicotinamide ring suggests that N-1 becomes pyramidal during the reaction. 18O fractionation factors for formate ion relative to aqueous solution are 1.0016 in sodium formate crystal, 1.0042 bound to Dowex-1, and 1.0040 as an ion pair (probably hydrated) in CHCl3. The CO2 analogue azide binds about 10(4) times better than the formate analogue nitrate to enzyme-nucleotide complexes (even though the Ki values for both and the affinity for formate vary by 2 orders of magnitude among the various nucleotides), but the ratio is not sensitive to the redox potential of the nucleotide. Thus, not the nature of the transition state but rather the shape of the initial binding pocket for formate is determining the relative affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "date": " 1984 ", "authors": ["Jeffrey D.

Most are resolved by a weighing of evidence and new findings. In some cases the arguments are personal and in the form of ad hominem attacks on the personality or integrity of an author of a journal article. Many famous scientists (e.g., Galileo, Newton, and Hooke) used ad hominem arguments in responding to their critics. William Bateson, W.F.R. Weldon, William Castle, and H.J. Muller used ad hominem arguments in their publications until the end of World War I, when editorial policy of journals changed. Motivating some of the attacks are philosophic differences (such as holistic or reductionist approaches to science), ideological differences (such as Marxist or Capitalist outlooks), politics (such as Cold War depictions by East and West on fallout from nuclear testing), or conflicts of interest (which can be professional or financial such as the debates over nontraditional and orthodox medicine or over tobacco smoking and health). Most of the time, the disputes are motivated by honest disagreements over the interpretation of the data. A recent surge (2009\u20132016) of ad hominem attacks by Edward Calabrese has appeared disparaging H. J. Muller, E. B. Lewis, other twentieth-century contributors to radiation genetics, and the National Academy of Sciences. They address the mutational effects of low-dose radiation exposure. Calabrese\u2019s attacks have led to responses by geneticists in the field of mutagenesis, by agencies criticized by Calabrese, and by students and colleagues of those who have been accused of deception by Calabrese. This article reviews some of the history of ad hominem arguments in science and the background to the attacks by Calabrese.

This may be used both to mediate transient changes in transcription, through modification of promoter-proximal nucleosomes, and for the longer-term maintenance and modulation of patterns of gene expression. The latter may be achieved by setting specific patterns of histone acetylation, perhaps involving acetylation of particular lysine residues, across relatively large chromatin domains. The histone acetylating and deacetylating enzymes (HATs and HDACs, respectively) can be targeted to specific regions of the genome and show varying degrees of substrate specificity, properties that are consistent with a role in maintaining a dynamic, acetylation-based epigenetic code. The code may be read (ie. exert a functional effect) either through non-histone proteins that bind in an acetylation-dependent manner, or through direct effects on chromatin structure.

However, symbionts, which can be subject to genetic limitations such as clonality and genomic degradation, also impose constraints on hosts. A model of obligate symbiosis is that between aphids and the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, which supplies essential nutrients. We report a mutation in Buchnera of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum that recurs in laboratory lines and occurs in field populations. This single nucleotide deletion affects a homopolymeric run within the heat-shock transcriptional promoter for ibpA, encoding a small heat-shock protein. This Buchnera mutation virtually eliminates the transcriptional response of ibpA to heat stress and lowers its expression even at cool or moderate temperatures. Furthermore, this symbiont mutation dramatically affects host fitness in a manner dependent on thermal environment. Following a short heat exposure as juveniles, aphids bearing short-allele symbionts produced few or no progeny and contained almost no Buchnera, in contrast to aphids bearing symbionts without the deletion. Conversely, under constant cool conditions, aphids containing symbionts with the short allele reproduced earlier and maintained higher reproductive rates. The short allele has appreciable frequencies in field populations (up to 20%), further supporting the view that lowering of ibpA expression improves host fitness under some conditions. This recurring Buchnera mutation governs thermal tolerance of aphid hosts. Other cases in which symbiont microevolution has a major effect on host ecological tolerance are likely to be widespread because of the high mutation rates of symbiotic bacteria and their crucial roles in host metabolism and development.", "date": " 2007 ", "authors": ["Helen E Dunbar", "Alex C.

The frontal lobe is involved in functions such as creative thinking, planning of future actions, decision making, artistic expression, aspects of emotional behavior, as well as working memory, language and motor control. It is often claimed that the frontal lobe is disproportionately larger in humans than in other species, but conflicting reports exist on this issue. The brain of the apes in particular remains largely unknown. In this report we measure the volume of the frontal lobe as a whole and of its main sectors (including cortex and immediately underlying white matter) in living humans, and in post-mortem brains of the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, gibbon and the macaque using three-dimensional reconstructions of magnetic resonance (MR) scans of the brain. On the basis of these data we suggest that although the absolute volume of the brain and the frontal lobe is largest in humans, the relative size of the frontal lobe is similar across hominoids, and that humans do not have a larger frontal lobe than expected from a primate brain of the human size. We also report that the relative size of the sectors of the frontal lobe (dorsal, mesial, orbital) is similar across the primate species studied. Our conclusions are preliminary, because the size of our sample, although larger than in previous studies, still remains small. With this caveat we conclude that the overall volume of the frontal lobe in hominids enlarged in absolute size along with the rest of the brain, but did not become relatively larger after the split of the human line from the ancestral African hominoid stock.

In aphids without PASS or PAR, heat stress reduced the number of bacteriocytes (in which the obligate primary symbiont, Buchnera, resides) to 7% of non-heat-stressed aphids, while aphids with only PASS retained 70% of their bacteriocytes. Bacteriocytes in aphids with PAR but not PASS were reduced to 42% of controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When larvae were heat-stressed as older instars (5\u00a0days old), a similar pattern emerged, though the effect of heat stress was less extreme. Clones containing PASS produced the most offspring, three to 14 times as many as aphids without PASS or PAR. Aphids with PAR only, or PASS and PAR together, had reduced or no advantage over aphids without facultative symbionts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Aphids of all clones that had been heat-stressed as later instars gave birth to a variable number of stillborn offspring. Aphids without facultative symbionts produced the most stillborn larvae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

The enzyme induces the formation of an adenosyl radical from the cofactor. This radical then initiates a free-radical rearrangement of its substrate, succinyl-CoA, to methylmalonyl-CoA.   Results  Reported here is the crystal structure at 2 a resolution of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from  Propionibacterium shermanii  in complex with coenzyme B 12  and with the partial substrate desulpho-CoA (lacking the succinyl group and the sulphur atom of the substrate). The coenzyme is bound by a domain which shares a similar fold to those of flavodoxin and the B 12 -binding domain of methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase. The cobalt atom is coordinated, via a long bond, to a histidine from the protein. The partial substrate is bound along the axis of a ( \u03b2 / \u03b1 ) 8  TIM barrel domain.   Conclusion  The histidine\u2013cobalt distance is very long (2.5 a compared with 1.95\u20132.2 a in free cobalamins), suggesting that the enzyme positions the histidine in order to weaken the metal\u2013carbon bond of the cofactor and favour the formation of the initial radical species.

By optimizing the placement of VMs on host machines, traffic patterns among VMs can be better aligned with the communication distance between them, e.g. VMs with large mutual bandwidth usage are assigned to host machines in close proximity. We formulate the VM placement as an optimization problem and prove its hardness. We design a two-tier approximate algorithm that efficiently solves the VM placement problem for very large problem sizes. Given the significant difference in the traffic patterns seen in current data centers and the structural differences of the recently proposed data center architectures, we further conduct a comparative analysis on the impact of the traffic patterns and the network architectures on the potential performance gain of traffic-aware VM placement.

We model such interference using a conflict graph, and present methods for computing upper and lower bounds on the optimal throughput for the given network and workload. To compute these bounds, we assume that packet transmissions at the individual nodes can be finely controlled and carefully scheduled by an omniscient and omnipotent central entity, which is unrealistic. Nevertheless, using ns-2 simulations, we show that the routes derived from our analysis often yield noticeably better throughput than the default shortest path routes even in the presence of uncoordinated packet transmissions and MAC contention.

System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including interacting bad measurements introduced by arbitrary, nonrandom causes. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers.In this article, we expose an unknown vulnerability of existing bad measurement detection algorithms by presenting and analyzing a new class of attacks, called false data injection attacks, against state estimation in electric power grids. Under the assumption that the attacker can access the current power system configuration information and manipulate the measurements of meters at physically protected locations such as substations, such attacks can introduce arbitrary errors into certain state variables without being detected by existing algorithms. Moreover, we look at two scenarios, where the attacker is either constrained to specific meters or limited in the resources required to compromise meters. We show that the attacker can systematically and efficiently construct attack vectors in both scenarios to change the results of state estimation in arbitrary ways. We also extend these attacks to generalized false data injection attacks, which can further increase the impact by exploiting measurement errors typically tolerated in state estimation. We demonstrate the success of these attacks through simulation using IEEE test systems, and also discuss the practicality of these attacks and the real-world constraints that limit their effectiveness.", "date": " 2011 ", "authors": ["Yao Liu", "Peng Ning", "Michael K.

While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area.\r\n\r\nThe intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas.\r\n\r\nThe handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming.\r\n\r\n- Covers the whole field of constraint programming\r\n- Survey-style chapters\r\n- Five chapters on applications\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nForeword (Ugo Montanari) \r\nPart I : Foundations\r\nChapter 1.

In the present study, we demonstrate that this tRNA species also occurs in vivo as selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser) suggesting that it functions both as a carrier molecule upon which selenocysteine is synthesized and as a direct selenocysteine donor to a growing polypeptide chain in response to specific UGA codons. [75Se]Seleno[3H]cysteyl-tRNA(Ser) formed by administering 75Se and [3H]serine to rat mammary tumor cells (TMT-081-MS) in culture was isolated from the cell extract. The amino acid attached to the tRNA was identified as selenocysteine following its deacylation and reaction with iodoacetate and 3-bromopropionate. The resulting alkyl derivatives co-chromatographed on an amino acid analyzer with authentic carboxymethylselenocysteine and carboxyethylselenocysteine.

Subsequent studies have shown that UGA codes for tryptophan in Mycoplasma spp. and in all nonplant mitochondria that have been examined. Universal stop codons UAA and UAG code for glutamine in ciliated protozoa (except Euplotes octacarinatus) and in a green alga, Acetabularia. E. octacarinatus uses UAA for stop and UGA for cysteine. Candida species, which are yeasts, use CUG (leucine) for serine. Other departures from the universal code, all in nonplant mitochondria, are CUN (leucine) for threonine (in yeasts), AAA (lysine) for asparagine (in platyhelminths and echinoderms), UAA (stop) for tyrosine (in planaria), and AGR (arginine) for serine (in several animal orders) and for stop (in vertebrates). We propose that the changes are typically preceded by loss of a codon from all coding sequences in an organism or organelle, often as a result of directional mutation pressure, accompanied by loss of the tRNA that translates the codon. The codon reappears later by conversion of another codon and emergence of a tRNA that translates the reappeared codon with a different assignment.

Since elimination of the gamma-substituent is necessary for both reactions, it is reasonable to assume that the replacement and elimination reaction pathways diverge from a common intermediate. Previously, this partitioning intermediate has been assigned to a highly conjugated alpha-iminovinylglycine quininoid (Johnston et al., 1979a). The experiments reported herein support an alternative assignment for the partitioning intermediate. We have examined the gamma-replacement and gamma-elimination reactions of cystathionine gamma-synthase via rapid-scanning stopped-flow and single-wavelength stopped-flow UV-visible spectroscopy. The gamma-elimination reaction is characterized by a rapid decrease in the amplitude of the enzyme internal aldimine spectral band at 422 nm with a concomitant appearance of a new species which absorbs in the 300-nm region. A 485-nm species subsequently accumulates in a much slower relaxation. The gamma-replacement reaction shows a red shift of the 422-nm peak to 425 nm which occurs in the experiment dead time (approximately 3 ms). This relaxation is followed by a decrease in absorbance at 425 nm that is tightly coupled to the appearance of a species which absorbs in the 300-nm region. Reaction of the substrate analogues L-alanine and L-allylglycine with cystathionine gamma-synthase results in bleaching of the 422-nm absorbance and the appearance of a 300-nm species. In the absence of L-cysteine, L-allylglycine undergoes facile proton exchange; in the presence of L-cysteine, L-allylglycine undergoes a gamma-replacement reaction to form a new amino acid, gamma-methylcystathionine. No long-wavelength-absorbing species accumulate during either of these reactions.

We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change.

Conventional cloning methods are time-consuming and lack uniformity. Thus, biological research is in great need of new techniques to rapidly, systematically and uniformly manipulate the large sets of genes currently available from genome projects.   Results:  We describe a series of new cloning methods that facilitate the rapid and systematic construction of recombinant DNA molecules. The central cloning method is named the univector plasmid-fusion system (UPS). The UPS uses Cre\u2013 lox  site-specific recombination to catalyze plasmid fusion between the univector \u2013 a plasmid containing the gene of interest \u2013 and host vectors containing regulatory information. Fusion events are genetically selected and place the gene under the control of new regulatory elements. A second UPS-related method allows for the precise transfer of coding sequences only from the univector into a host vector. The UPS eliminates the need for restriction enzymes, DNA ligases and many  in vitro  manipulations required for subcloning, and allows for the rapid construction of multiple constructs for expression in multiple organisms. We demonstrate that UPS can also be used to transfer whole libraries into new vectors. Additional adaptations are described, including directional PCR cloning and the generation of 3\u2032 end gene fusions using homologous recombination in  Escherichia coli .

We prospectively analyzed routine MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification in parallel with conventional phenotypic identification of bacteria regardless of phylum or source of isolation. Discrepancies were resolved by 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoB gene sequence-based molecular identification. Colonies (4 spots per isolate directly deposited on the MALDI-TOF plate) were analyzed using an Autoflex II Bruker Daltonik mass spectrometer. Peptidic spectra were compared with the Bruker BioTyper database, version 2.0, and the identification score was noted. Delays and costs of identification were measured. Results. Of 1660 bacterial isolates analyzed, 95.4% were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; 84.1% were identified at the species level, and 11.3% were identified at the genus level. In most cases, absence of identification (2.8% of isolates) and erroneous identification (1.7% of isolates) were due to improper database entries.

The agent is often visualized in tissue sections of lesions with Warthin-Starry staining, but the bacillus has not been successfully cultured or identified. This bacillus may also cause cat scratch disease.  Methods  In attempting to identify this organism, we used the polymerase chain reaction. We used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 16S ribosomal RNA genes of eubacteria to amplify 16S ribosomal gene fragments directly from tissue samples of bacillary angiomatosis. The DNA sequence of these fragments was determined and analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness to other known organisms. Normal tissues were studied in parallel.  Results  Tissue from three unrelated patients with bacillary angiomatosis yielded a unique 16S gene sequence. A sequence obtained from a fourth patient with bacillary angiomatosis differed from the sequence found in the other three patients at only 4 of 241 base positions. No related 16S gene fragment was detected in the normal tissues. These 16S sequences associated with bacillary angiomatosis belong to a previously uncharacterized microorganism, most closely related to Rochalimaea quintana.

Zooxanthellae and some Bacteria form relatively stable and species-specific associations with corals. Other associations are less specific; coral-associated Archaea differ from those in the water column, but the same archaeal species may be found on different coral species. It has been hypothesized that the coral animal can adapt to differing ecological niches by 'switching' its microbial associates. In the case of corals and zooxanthellae, this has been termed adaptive bleaching and it has important implications for carbon cycling within the coral holobiont and ultimately the survival of coral reefs. However, the roles of other components of the coral holobiont are essentially unknown. To better understand these other coral associates, a fractionation procedure was used to separate the microbes, mitochondria and viruses from the coral animal cells and zooxanthellae. The resulting metagenomic DNA was sequenced using pyrosequencing. Fungi, Bacteria and phage were the most commonly identified organisms in the metagenome. Three of the four fungal phyla were represented, including a wide diversity of fungal genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that the endolithic community is more important than previously appreciated. In particular, the data suggested that endolithic fungi could be converting nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, which would enable fixed nitrogen to cycle within the coral holobiont. The most prominent bacterial groups were Proteobacteria (68%), Firmicutes (10%), Cyanobacteria (7%) and Actinobacteria (6%). Functionally, the bacterial community was primarily heterotrophic and included a number of pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds, the most abundant being the homogentisate pathway. The most abundant phage family was the ssDNA Microphage and most of the eukaryotic viruses were most closely related to those known to infect aquatic organisms.

Zool. 27:401-410.-For some simple threeand four-species cases involving a character with two states, it is determined under what conditions several methods of phylogenetic inference will fail to converge to the true phylogeny as mo,re and more data are accumulated. The methods are the Camin-Sokal parsimony method, the compatibility method, and Farris's unrooted Wagner tree parsimony method. In all cases the conditions for this failure (which is the failure to be statistically consistent) are essentially that parallel changes exceed informative, nonparallel changes. It is possible for these methods to be inconsistent even when change is improbable a priori, provided that evolutionary rates in different lineages are sufficiently unequal. It is by extension of this approach that we may provide a sound methodology for evaluating methods of phylogenetic inference. [Numerical cladistics; phylogenetic inference; maximum likelihood estimation; parsimony; compatibility.] Parsimony or minimum evolution methods were first introduced into phylogenetic inference by Camin and Sokal (1965). This class of methods for inferring an evolutionary tree from discrete-character data involves making a reconstruction of the changes in a given set of characters on a given tree, counting the smallest number of times that a given kind of event need have happened, and using this as the measure of the adequacy of the evolutionary tree. (Alternatively, one can compute the weighted sum of the numbers of times several different kinds of events have occurred.) One attempts to find that evolutionary tree which requires the fewest of these evolutionary events to explain the observed data.

A number of other parsimony methods have since appeared in the systematic literature (Kluge and Farris, 1969; Farris, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1977; Farris, Kluge, and Eckhardt, 1970) and parsimony methods have also found widespread use in studies of molecular evolution (Fitch and Margoliash, 1967, 1970; Dayhoff and Eck, 1968; see also Fitch, 1973). Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967; Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza, 1964) earlier formulated a minimum evolution method for continuous-character data. An alternative methodology for phylogenetic inference is the compatibility method, introduced by Le Quesne (1969, 1972). He suggested that phylogenetic inference be based on finding the largest possible set of characters -which could simultaneously have all states be uniquely derived -on the same ftree. The estimate of the phylogeny is then takento be that tree.-While Le Quesne's specific suggestions as to how this might be done have been criticized by Farris (1969), his general approach, which is based on Camin and Sokal's (1965) concept of the compatibility of two characters, has been made rigorous and extended in a series of papers by G.

Small-subunit rRNA genes (rDNA) were amplified directly from OP sediment DNA by PCR with universally conserved or Bacteria-specific rDNA primers and cloned. Unique rDNA types among >300 clones were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and 122 representative rDNA sequences were determined. These were found to represent 54 distinct bacterial sequence types or clusters (\u226598% identity) of sequences. A majority (70%) of the sequence types were affiliated with 14 previously recognized bacterial divisions (main phyla; kingdoms); 30% were unaffiliated with recognized bacterial divisions. The unaffiliated sequence types (represented by 38 sequences) nominally comprise 12 novel, division level lineages termed candidate divisions. Several OP sequences were nearly identical to those of cultivated chemolithotrophic thermophiles, including the hydrogen-oxidizing Calderobacterium and the sulfate reducers Thermodesulfovibrio and Thermodesulfobacterium, or belonged to monophyletic assemblages recognized for a particular type of metabolism, such as the hydrogen-oxidizing Aquificales and the sulfate-reducing \u03b4-Proteobacteria. The occurrence of such organisms is consistent with the chemical composition of OP (high in reduced iron and sulfur) and suggests a lithotrophic base for primary productivity in this hot spring, through hydrogen oxidation and sulfate reduction. Unexpectedly, no archaeal sequences were encountered in OP clone libraries made with universal primers. Hybridization analysis of amplified OP DNA with domain-specific probes confirmed that the analyzed community rDNA from OP sediment was predominantly bacterial.

They are produced by classical fermenting bacteria for disposal of electrons derived in simultaneous substrate oxidations. Methanogenic bacteria can degrade primarily only one-carbon compounds. Therefore, acetate, propionate, ethanol, and their higher homologs have to be fermented further to one-carbon compounds. These fermentations are called secondary or syntrophic fermentations. They are endergonic processes under standard conditions and depend on intimate coupling with methanogenesis. The energetic situation of the prokaryotes cooperating in these processes is problematic: the free energy available in the reactions for total conversion of substrate to methane attributes to each partner amounts of energy in the range of the minimum biochemically convertible energy, i.e., 20 to 25 kJ per mol per reaction. This amount corresponds to one-third of an ATP unit and is equivalent to the energy required for a monovalent ion to cross the charged cytoplasmic membrane.

The control of secretion of MP is an eloquent example of the molecular complexities and the intricate congrol mechanisms - internal and external - operating at each step of each regulatory process. A final comment concern the question of macrophage heterogeneity. Is the same cell performing all the functions of degradation, presentation, and secretion - or cytotoxicity? Or do we have subpopulation, each with a different role? This issue is not settled. The unitarians argue that the phagocytes pass through different stages of differentiation and that each function may become more or less prominent at each stage. Certainly, the manner in which each macrophage function is assayed can condition the outcome: for antigen presentation, one adds 1 % of macrophages to cultures of spleen cells; for cytotoxic assays, the figure is 50 to 100 macrophages per tumor cell! It is our feeling that until such time as membrane molecules are identified and used as probes for differentiation or for identification of subsets we will not resolve this issue. Along these lines, macrophages have been found to have Ia antigens (Hammerling et al. 1975, Schwartz et al. 1976) and can be divided into two sets on the basis of the presence or absence of Ia.

Empirical treatments were tested before culture was possible, but the only in vitro bactericidal treatment consists of a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS Our laboratory has been a reference centre since the first culturing of Tropheryma whipplei, and we have tested 27,000 samples by PCR and diagnosed 250 cases of classic Whipple's disease. We report here the clinical course of patients who were followed by one of our group. RESULTS Of 29 patients, 22 (76%) were previously treated with immunosuppressive drugs, 26 (90%) suffered from arthralgias and 22 (76%) exhibited weight loss. Intravenous initial treatment was paradoxically associated with an increased risk of failure (P = 0.0282). Treatment with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine (\u00b1 sulfadiazine or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) was associated with a better outcome (0/13 failures), whereas all 14 patients who were first treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and referred to us (P < 0.0001) experienced failure. Among the patients treated with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine after previous antibiotic treatments, two presented with a reinfection caused by different T. whipplei strains. Finally, serum therapeutic drug monitoring allowed us to detect a lack of compliance in the only patient with failure among the 22 patients treated with lifetime doxycycline.

This handling of antigen is done without contributing to the specificity of the immune response, which is determined by the antigenreactive T and B lymphocytes. During the process of uptake of antigen, macrophages appear to retain a few molecules of antigen, undegraded or with few chemical changes. Macrophage-associated antigen becomes an effective immunogenic stimulus mainly in conditions that require two types of lymphocytes to meet with antigen molecules. These lymphocytes are specifically antigen-committed and few in number. The positive immunogenic role of macrophages is related to their capacity to (1) remove extracellular antigen, which might be capable of interacting with and eliminating isolated T or B lymphocytes and (2) retain antigen in lymphoid tissues and promote its necessary meeting with both T and B cells.", "date": " 1972 ", "authors": ["Emil Unanue"], "related_topics": ["antigen processing", "antigen", "macrophage-1 antigen", "antigen-presenting cell", "major histocompatibility complex", "immune system", "extracellular", "immunology", "biology", "antigenic stimulation", "animals", "antigen-antibody complex"], "citation_count": "637", "reference_count": "263", "references": []}, {"id": "2314246994", "title": "Principles and practice of infectious disease", "abstract": null, "date": " 1990 ", "authors": ["K.J.

The reservoir of the agent of Whipple disease is unknown. Asymptomatic carriage of Tropheryma whipplei in human stool and saliva is controversial. Methods. Stools and saliva specimens from 231 workers at a sewage treatment facility and from 10 patients with Whipple disease, stool specimens from 102 healthy people, and stool specimens from 127 monkeys or apes were tested for T. whipplei DNA by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with probe detection.

Asymptomatic carriage in stool was found in humans (ranging from a prevalence of 4% in the control group to 12% among a subgroup of sewer workers) but not in monkeys and apes. The T. whipplei load in stool was significantly lower in carriers than in patients with Whipple disease (P <.001). There was a significant prevalence gradient associated with employment responsibilities at the sewage treatment facility: workers who cleaned the underground portion of the sewers were more likely than other workers to carry T. whipplei in stool. Seven of 9 sewer workers tested positive 8 months later. Patients with Whipple disease were significantly more likely to have T. whipplei-positive saliva specimens (P =.005) and had a significantly greater T. whipplei load in saliva (P =.015), compared with asymptomatic stool carriers from the sewage facility. All non-stool carriers had T. whipplei-negative saliva specimens. T. whipplei strains were heterogeneic among sewer workers but identical within individual workers. Conclusion.

Blood culture-negative endocarditis (BCNE) may account for up to 31% of all cases of endocarditis. METHODS. We used a prospective, multimodal strategy incorporating serological, molecular, and histopathological assays to investigate specimens from 819 patients suspected of having BCNE. RESULTS. Diagnosis of endocarditis was first ruled out for 60 patients. Among 759 patients with BCNE, a causative microorganism was identified in 62.7%, and a noninfective etiology in 2.5%. Blood was the most useful specimen, providing a diagnosis for 47.7% of patients by serological analysis (mainly Q fever and Bartonella infections). Broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood and Bartonella-specific Western blot methods diagnosed 7 additional cases. PCR of valvular biopsies identified 109 more etiologies, mostly streptococci, Tropheryma whipplei, Bartonella species, and fungi. Primer extension enrichment reaction and autoimmunohistochemistry identified a microorganism in 5 additional patients. No virus or Chlamydia species were detected. A noninfective cause of endocarditis, particularly neoplasic or autoimmune disease, was determined by histological analysis or by searching for antinuclear antibodies in 19 (2.5%) of the patients. Our diagnostic strategy proved useful and sensitive for BCNE workup. CONCLUSIONS. We highlight the major role of zoonotic agents and the underestimated role of noninfective diseases in BCNE. We propose serological analysis for Coxiella burnetii and Bartonella species, detection of antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor as first-line tests, followed by specific PCR assays for T. whipplei, Bartonella species, and fungi in blood.

In contrast to fluorescence measurement once per cycle, continuous monitoring throughout each cycle monitors the temperature dependence of fluorescence. The cumulative, irreversible signal of hydrolysis probes can be distinguished easily from the temperature-dependent, reversible signal of hybridization probes. By using SYBR Green I, product denaturation, annealing and extension can be followed within each cycle.

WD DNA has been found in stool and saliva specimens from patients and asymptomatic carriers.  Methods  A total of 4418 samples that were sent to our center for determination of WD were tested by a T. whipplei-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on repetitive sequences. Definite WD was diagnosed in 71 patients, including 55 patients with classic WD (defined by positive results of periodic acid-Schiff staining and/or specific immunohistochemistry of small-bowel biopsy specimens) and 16 patients with localized WD (including patients with endocarditis, neurologic infection, and uveitis).  Results  Of the persons without WD, 2.3% had stool specimens positive for T. whipplei by PCR and 0.2% had saliva specimens positive for T. whipplei by PCR. Diagnosis of WD was likely in patients with positive results of both PCR of saliva specimens and PCR of stool specimens (positive predictive value, 95.2%). When the bacterial load was >10(4) colony-forming units per g of stool, the positive predictive value was 100%. A negative result of PCR of a saliva or stool specimen had a negative predictive value of 99.2% for classic WD. For localized WD, positive results of both PCR of saliva specimens and PCR of stool specimens had a sensitivity of 58% (compared with 94% for classic WD). The positive predictive value of testing of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine specimens was 100% for each, and the positive predictive value for testing of duodenal biopsy specimens was 97.5%.  Conclusions  T. whipplei-specific quantitative PCR of saliva and stool specimens should be performed as first-line noninvasive screening for WD. When the results for both types of specimens are positive, diagnosis of classic WD should be highly suspected, especially if a high bacterial load is detected. Because PCR of saliva and stool specimens lacks sensitivity for determination of localized WD, invasive samples should be tested on the basis of clinical manifestations.", "date": " 2008 ", "authors": ["Florence Fenollar", "Sonia Laouira", "Hubert Lepidi", "Jean-Marc Rolain", "Didier Raoult"], "related_topics": ["tropheryma whipplei", "mass screening", "saliva", "predictive value of tests", "whipple disease", "real-time polymerase chain reaction", "biopsy", "asymptomatic carrier", "pathology", "medicine", "adult", "aged"], "citation_count": "183", "reference_count": "35", "references": ["2399757284", "2335836975", "2144080673", "2336422260", "1984005199", "2127239044", "2166842843", "2171925188", "2105598745", "2035250308", "2130340297", "2158317675"]}, {"id": "2035250308", "title": "Whipple's disease.", "abstract": "Whipple\u2019s disease is an infectious disease caused by a grampositive bacterium, Tropheryma whipplei.

We report a retrospective clinical study of 52 patients recruited in various parts of France from 1967 to 1994. Seventy-three percent of the patients were male. Clinical manifestations preceding the diagnosis were articular for 35 patients (67%), digestive for 8 patients (15%), general for 7 patients (14%), and neurologic for 2 patients (4%). At a later stage of the disease, 44 patients (85%) presented diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption, while 8 patients (15%) did not show any gastrointestinal symptom throughout the development of the disease. Forty-three patients (83%) presented arthralgia or arthritis, and 11 (21%) had prominent neurologic symptoms. In addition, cardiovascular symptoms were present in 9 patients (17%); mucocutaneous symptoms, in 9 patients (17%); pleuropulmonary symptoms, in 7 patients (13%); and ophthalmologic symptoms, in 5 patients (10%). All patients but 1 were given a positive diagnosis on histopathologic criteria: jejunal biopsy for 46 patients (90%), lymph node biopsy for 3 patients (6%), brain biopsy for 1 patient (2%), postmortem jejunal and cerebral biopsy for 1 patient (2%). With treatment, the disease evolved favorably in 47 patients (90%), while 5 patients (10%) had unfavorable outcomes (2 deaths from neurologic involvement, 1 patient with chronic dementia, and 2 patients with digestive symptoms insensitive to antimicrobial therapy). Of the 41 patients initially treated successfully and whose treatment has been completed, clinical evolution after discontinuation of treatment was favorable in 34 cases (83%). Clinical relapses occurred in 7 patients. No relapse was observed after treatment by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, alone or following a combination of penicillin and streptomycin, or after the combination of penicillin and streptomycin, whatever the oral follow-up treatment prescribed. The evolution of patients showing a relapse was favorable in all cases after reintroduction of antibiotic therapy. These results are discussed in the light of previously published series and case reports of Whipple disease. The diagnosis of the disease remains difficult at an early phase or when digestive symptoms are absent. It is noteworthy that proximal enteroscopy is sometimes misleading, considered normal on macroscopic examination and nonspecific on pathologic grounds. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate represents another pitfall. Histopathology is the key for positive and differential diagnosis, and may require multiple and repeated biopsies. Findings from molecular biology confirm the central role of an uncultured Gram-positive bacillus which was named in 1992 Tropheryma whippelii. A recent report suggests that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of peripheral blood might allow the diagnosis of Whipple disease in some cases. However, immunologic or cellular parameters such as macrophagic function may play an important, although not clearly elucidated, role in the pathogeny of the disease.

II. Cellular cooperation.", "abstract": "The adoptive secondary response of mice to conjugates of NIP (4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitro-phenacetyl-) and DNP (2,4-dinitrophenyl-) is here used to elucidate the mechanism of cellular cooperation. The framework into which the experiments fit can be formulated as follows. Priming immunization raises a crop not only of specific antibody-forming-cell-precursors (AFCP) but also of specific helper cells. Upon secondary stimulation the helper cells serve a role as handlers or concentrators of antigen, thus enabling AFCP which would otherwise be incapable of reacting to initiate antibody synthesis. In this act of cooperation both cells recognise antigen; in the system examined here the helpers recognise carrier determinants and the AFCP recognise either the hapten or other carrier determinants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first aim of the experiments was to raise populations of helpers and AFCP of distinguishable specificity. Mice were primed with NIP-Ovalbumin (OA) mixed with chicken \u03b3-globulin (CGG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA); in comparison with controls primed with unmixed NIP-OA, their cells after transfer were relatively more sensitive to secondary stimulation with NIP-CGG or NIP-BSA and similar findings were obtained in cross-checks of these carriers. For reasons which are not entirely clear, non-transferred cells did not show the same effect. In further experiments cells primed with one conjugate (e. g. NIP-OA) were mixed with cells primed with another protein (e. g. BSA), transferred and challenged with the hapten conjugated to the second protein (i. e. NIP-BSA). In comparison with controls lacking the protein-primed cells, the mixture regularly showed greater sensitivity to stimulation. NIP and DNP were tested in many of the possible combinations with BSA, OA and CGG with the same result. The mixture system was used in the further analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTests with allotype-marked protein-primed cells showed that these cells did not participate in the production of the anti-hapten antibody and could therefore properly be regarded as helpers. Tests of specificity showed that physical union of the hapten and carrier were required: cells primed with BSA, for example, would not help NIP-OA-primed cells to make a response to NIP-HSA even when stimulated at the same time with BSA.

It occurs primarily in Caucasian males older than 40 years. The gastrointestinal tract is the most frequently involved organ, with manifestations such as abdominal pain, malabsorption syndrome with diarrhea, and weight loss. Other signs include low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, skin hyperpigmentation, endocarditis, pleuritis, seronegative arthritis, uveitis, spondylodiscitis, and neurological manifestations, and these signs may occur in the absence of gastrointestinal manifestations. Due to the wide variability of manifestations, clinical diagnosis is very difficult and is often made only years or even decades after the initial symptoms have appeared. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for at least 1 year is usually considered adequate to eradicate the infection. The microbiological diagnosis of this insidious disease is rendered difficult by the virtual lack of culture and serodiagnostic methods. It is usually based on the demonstration of periodic acid-Schiff-positive particles in infected tissues and/or the presence of bacteria with an unusual trilaminar cell wall ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Recently, the Whipple bacteria have been characterized at the molecular level by amplification of their 16S rRNA gene(s). Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed a new bacterial species related to the actinomycete branch which was named \u201cTropheryma whippelli.\u201d Based on its unique 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence, species-specific primers were selected for the detection of the organism in clinical specimens by PCR. This technique is currently used as one of the standard methods for establishing the diagnosis of Whipple's disease. Specific and broad-spectrum PCR amplifications mainly but not exclusively from extraintestinal specimens have significantly improved diagnosis, being more sensitive than histopathologic analysis. However, \u201cT. whippelii\u201d DNA has also been found in persons without clinical and histological evidence of Whipple's disease. It is unclear whether these patients are true asymptomatic carriers or whether differences in virulence exist among strains of \u201cT. whippelii\u201d that might account for the variable clinical manifestations. So far, six different \u201cT. whippelii\u201d subtypes have been found by analysis of their 16S-23S rDNA spacer region.

Thoracic duct cells injected with sheep erythrocytes significantly increased the number of hemolytic foci and 10 million cells gave rise to over 1000 hemolysin-forming cells per spleen. A synergistic effect was observed when syngeneic thoracic duct cells were mixed with syngeneic marrow cells: the number of hemolysin-forming cells produced in this case was far greater than could be accounted for by summating the activities of either cell population given alone. The number of hemolytic foci produced by the mixed population was not however greater than that produced by an equivalent number of thoracic duct cells given without bone marrow. Thymus cells given together with syngeneic bone marrow enabled irradiated mice to produce hemolysin-forming cells but were much less effective than the same number of thoracic duct cells. Likewise syngeneic thymus cells were not as effective as thoracic duct cells in enabling thymectomized irradiated bone marrow-protected hosts to produce hemolysin-forming cells in response to sheep erythrocytes. Irradiated recipients of semiallogeneic thoracic duct cells produced hemolysin-forming cells of donor-type as shown by the use of anti-H2 sera. The identity of the hemolysin-forming cells in the spleens of irradiated mice receiving a mixed inoculum of semiallogeneic thoracic duct cells and syngeneic marrow was not determined because no synergistic effect was obtained in these recipients in contrast to the results in the syngeneic situation. Thymectomized irradiated mice protected with bone marrow for a period of 2 wk and injected with semiallogeneic thoracic duct cells together with sheep erythrocytes did however produce a far greater number of hemolysin-forming cells than irradiated mice receiving the same number of thoracic duct cells without bone marrow. Anti-H2 sera revealed that the antibody-forming cells arising in the spleens of these thymectomized irradiated hosts were derived, not from the injected thoracic duct cells, but from bone marrow. It is concluded that thoracic duct lymph contains a mixture of cell types: some are hemolysin-forming cell precursors and others are antigen-reactive cells which can interact with antigen and initiate the differentiation of hemolysin-forming cell precursors to antibody-forming cells. Bone marrow contains only precursors of hemolysin-forming cells and thymus contains only antigen-reactive cells but in a proportion that is far less than in thoracic duct lymph.", "date": " 1968 ", "authors": ["G.

Other secretory products such as angiotropin and human angiogenic factor (HAF) are nonmitogenic but promote angiogenesis by inducing migration of endothelial cells. Prostaglandins, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), granulocyte-macrophage- and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, G-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) have also been shown to be angiogenic,`but their mode of action is still to be clearly defined.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) have complex actions on endothelial cells, and can partially inhibit angiogenesis.

The presentation of antigen bound to live macrophages to the lymphocytes was a highly efficient mode of generating an immune response. In the marine system, the requirement for phagocytes or other acc|essory cells was such that as little as 1% contamination with phagocytes still enabled a T-cell proliferative response to develop. Thus, depletion procedures had to be extremely efficient. Macrophages are definitely involved in some response to many of the conventional polyclonal stimuli.

Other lymphocyte subsets with regulatory function include: inducible CD8(+) T(REG), CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T(REG) (double-negative), CD4(+)V\u03b114(+) (NKT(REG)), and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells. T(REG) have four regulatory modes of action: secretion of inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2), granzyme-perforin-induced apoptosis of effector lymphocytes, depriving effector T-cells of cytokines leading to apoptosis, or inhibition of dendritic cell function.

Preliminary studies with this method have led us to the following conclusions, which, however, unless otherwise stated, may be taken as applying only to the lymphocytes of the rat thymus. 1. The small thymus cells, when suspended in balanced phosphate solutions, show no distinct reaction to variations in hydrogen ion concentrations ranging between Ph 7.0 and PH 7.8. Beyond PH 7.0 there is a sudden increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye; plasmolysis of the cells occurs when the alkalinity exceeds PH 8.0. 2. Heating to 49\u00b0 or 50\u00b0C. is accompanied by a critical increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye. 3. The injury caused by lack of oxygen can be demonstrated by the increase in the number of stained cells. 4. The addition of serum to suspensions of thymus cells or tonsil lymphocytes greatly inhibits the diffusion of the trypan into the cells. The protection afforded is roughly proportionate to the amount of serum added. Gelatin also exerts a marked protective influence; egg albumin affords a partial protection; starch and gum arabic are inert. Hemoglobin and cholesterol do not modify the stainability of the cells. Arsenious sulfide in weak concentrations partially inhibits the diffusion of the dye. Colloidal iron is without effect, and is precipitated about the cells. 5. The toxicity of the photodynamic substance, hematoporphyrin, and of an impure chlorophyll solution in the presence of sunlight could be strikingly demonstrated by the greatly increased permeability of the cells to the stain. 6. Acute and chronic inanition produces an increased fragility of the cells. The protective power of the serum in acute starvation appears to be increased. 7. The small thymus cells of old animals are more readily injured than are those of young ones, as indicated by the increased proportion of stained cells. 8. The method has been applied to the demonstration of the action of cytotoxic immune sera for rat thymus cells and for human tonsil lymphocytes in vitro.

The change is stable and hereditary, being maintained even during prolonged propagation in the solid form.  The permanence of the change was controlled by quantitative methods measuring the multiplication of tumor cells in the peritoneal fluid. A procedure was developed to estimate the number of tumor cells from desoxypentosenucleic acid determinations and was found to agree well with direct counting techniques. The growth curve of MC1A sarcoma and some other ascites tumors that contain cell clumps cannot be determined by direct counting but is accessible by the DNA method.  Eight independent transfer lines were started with very small inocula (statistical average: 4.3 cells) from the original solid form of MC1A sarcoma which is regularly convertible to ascites form. Seven of the eight lines proved to be inconvertible under the same experimental conditions, indicating that the frequency of changed cells in the original solid population is rather low.  The selective advantage of the changed cells can be increased during the process of gradual conversion by using large inocula.  The change that enables tumor cells to multiply in the peritoneal fluid has been found to be correlated with a reduction of cellular adhesiveness and an increased capacity to metastasize to the lungs.

Lymphokines with a mol wt of 30,000, as estimated from gel filtration studies, can be resolved into two components which differ by charge, with isoelectric point (pI) values of 4.3 and 4.9, respectively. Both components stimulate (a) the growth of established T-cell lines in culture, (b) the proliferation of thymocytes in the presence of Con A under culture conditions where Con A alone is nonmitogenic, (c) the induction of antibody responses to heterologous erythrocyte antigens in athymic (nude) spleen cultures, (d) the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in thymocyte cultures, and (e) the generation of CTL in nude spleen cultures.

The three stimuli also enhanced O-.2 generation by normal (untreated) polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but only serum-treated zymosan and aggregated IgG were capable of provoking lysosomal enzyme release from normal cells. Untreated zymosan and native IgG neither stimulated O-.2 production nor provoked lysomal enzyme release.

The mere binding of lectins such as concanavalin A (Con A) to the surface membrane of T cells does not trigger the cells to go through the mitotic cycle.

Thus, cells were committed to DNA replication as early as 5 h after incubation with supra-optimal concentrations of ConA.

Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin), a trichothecene, is prevalent worldwide in crops used for food and feed production, including in Canada and the United States. Although DON is one of the least acutely toxic trichothecenes, it should be treated as an important food safety issue because it is a very common contaminant of grain. This review focuses on the ability of DON to induce toxicologic and immunotoxic effects in a variety of cell systems and animal species. At the cellular level, the main toxic effect is inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to the ribosome. In animals, moderate to low ingestion of toxin can cause a number of as yet poorly defined effects associated with reduced performance and immune function. The main overt effect at low dietary concentrations appears to be a reduction in food consumption (anorexia), while higher doses induce vomiting (emesis). DON is known to alter brain neurochemicals. The serotoninergic system appears to play a role in mediation of the feeding behavior and emetic response. Animals fed low to moderate doses are able to recover from initial weight losses, while higher doses induce more long-term changes in feeding behavior. At low dosages of DON, hematological, clinical, and immunological changes are also transitory and decrease as compensatory/adaptation mechanisms are established. Swine are more sensitive to DON than mice, poultry, and ruminants, in part because of differences in metabolism of DON, with males being more sensitive than females. The capacity of DON to alter normal immune function has been of particular interest. There is extensive evidence that DON can be immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory, depending upon the dose and duration of exposure. While immunosuppression can be explained by the inhibition of translation, immunostimulation can be related to interference with normal regulatory mechanisms. In vivo, DON suppresses normal immune response to pathogens and simultaneously induces autoimmune-like effects which are similar to human immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Other effects include superinduction of cytokine production by T helper cells (in vitro) and activation of macrophages and T cells to produce a proinflammatory cytokine wave that is analogous to that found in lipopolysaccharide-induced shock (in vivo). To what extent the elevation of cytokines contributes to metabolic effects such as decreased feed intake remains to be established. Although these effects have been largely characterized in the mouse, several investigations with DON suggest that immunotoxic effects are also likely in domestic animals. Further toxicology studies and an assessment of the potential of DON to be an etiologic agent in human disease are warranted.", "date": " 1996 ", "authors": ["Barbara A. Rotter", "Dan B.

Presence of Ia Determinants on Allogeneic Effect Factor", "abstract": "Observations from our own laboratories, as well as those of others, have demonstrated the critical role of histocompatibility gene products in governing the cell-cell interactions concerned with development and regulation of immune responses in several species (8-12). In mice, the relevant genes concerned have been shown to be located in the K end of the H-2 complex, i.e. in the K and/or I See PDF for Structure regions (13, 14). These discoveries have placed histocompatibility gene products on a more complex level of biologic function than was heretofore generally considered (15). Thus, the hypothesis was made from these observations that genes in the H-2 complex coded for products involved in the development of effective cell-cell interactions in the immune response (8, 9, 15). The recent identification of cell surface macromolecules on lymphocytes and macrophages, that may be distinct from immune response gene products but are likewise coded for by genes in the I region, has provided a group of suitable candidate molecules for such a role (2). In our initial studies on the biological and biochemical characteristics of AEF, we were impressed by the apparent preferential activity of the highly purified AEF preparations on B lymphocytes syngeneic to the activated T-cell population from which the AEF was obtained (1). Since a prediction of the aforementioned hypothesis is, of course, that the active molecules involved in regulatory immunocompetent cell interactions are gene products of the H-2 complex, and, accordingly, should be reactive with antisera directed against components of this complex, we were prompted to perform the appropriate analyses on our preparation of AEF. The experiments presented here demonstrate that the enhancing activity of AEF obtained from T cells of the H-2(d) haplotype can be specifically removed by immunoadsorbents prepared from antisera reactive with la molecules of the H-2(d) allele. Identical results were obtained in experiments with both direct and indirect absorption procedures. The possibility that the reaction of AEF with the B10.A anti-B10 (anti-Ia.8) antiserum resulted in release of some components that were in turn toxic to the cultured cells, has been made unlikely in these studies by the use of a direct adsorption method utilizing an immunoadsorbent prepared from thoroughly washed glutaraldehyde-linked antibodies. The results obtained with the (B6A)F(1) anti-B10.D2 antiserum deserve some comment. This antiserum contains antibodies directed predominantly against the H-2K region specificity, H-2.31, but may also be reactive with recently determined Ia(d) specificities (5). The capacity of this antiserum to directly absorb approximately 45% of the AEF activity at the lowest concentration of AEF employed (Fig. 1) could be interpreted to indicate the reactivity of AEF with anti-H-2K antibodies. However, the data presented here are also consistent with the interpretation that partial adsorption by the direct immunoadsorbent and lack of adsorption by the indirect method (in which only a high concentration of AEF was incubated with the alloantisera) reflect reactivity of AEF with anti-Ia(d) antibodies present in this antiserum. We conclude, therefore, that the biologically active enhancing moieties of AEF bear Ia determinants and therefore are most probably gene products of the I region of the H-2 gene complex. Recent data from other investigators have shown that an antigen-specific T-cell product could be specifically adsorbed by immunoadsorbents prepared from antisera directed against the K end of H-2 (16). Since the latter antisera may contain antibodies reactive with specificities of both K and I regions, it is possible that the use of selective anti-Ia sera may yield results consistent with those presented here. Taken collectively, these observations indicate that I-region gene products may be intimately involved in the mechanism of cell-cell interactions and responsible for the regulation of immune responses.", "date": " 1974 ", "authors": ["Dieter Armerding", "David H.

Velocity sedimentation and  3 HTdR autoradiographic studies of the suppressive population indicated that the effect is mediated by proliferating, large cells (\u201cblasts\u201d). Other populations of actively dividing cells, including normal lymphocytes stimulated with pokeweed mitogen or the calcium ionophore A23187, the Raji B cell line, and human and mouse fibroblasts, suppressed  3 HTdR uptake as well, in a similar dose range. The suppressive effect of these cells could be roughly correlated with the proportion of blasts in the cell population.  Inhibitory activity in this system was not demonstrated in supernatants from PHA blasts compared to saline controls, but intact cells suppressed across a nucleopore membrane but not a dialysis membrane. Supplementing the assay culture with low m.w. constituents of the medium did not decrease the suppressive effect. However, when fresh serum was added in increasing concentrations with the inhibitory cells, their suppressive effect was partially abrogated.  These results may be interpreted in at least two ways that are not mutually exclusive: i) PHA blasts may elaborate a labile inhibitory substance that may be bound, inactivated, or degraded to some degree by serum and/or ii) actively proliferating cells may exhaust an essential high m.w. nutrient in the assay culture.

Recently, it has become evident that T cell proliferation is mediated by a soluble T cell growth factor (TCGF) released by mitogen/antigen stimulated T cells. Therefore it seemed probable that the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids were manifested either at the level of TCGF production or at the level of the activated T lymphocyte. We found that differentiated cytolytic T lymphocytes harvested from TCGF-dependent long-term culture were only mildly sensitive to inhibitory effects (25 to 30% inhibition) of glucocorticoids as measured by decreased cellular proliferation and the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. The degree of inhibition observed was most probably mediated through glucocorticoid receptors in that the half maximal inhibitory glucocorticoid concentration correlated with half-maximal glucocorticoid receptor saturation. In contrast, we found that mitogen-induced TCGF production and T cell proliferation were completely inhibited by pharmacologic concentrations of dexamethasone (10 -6  M). Finally, the TCGF supplementation of mitogen-stimulated cultures treated with maximal inhibitory concentrations of dexamethasone resulted in complete amelioration of glucocorticoid suppression.

The causative agents are thought to be a family of compounds called fumonisins, which bear considerable structural similarity to the long-chain (sphingoid) base backbones of sphingolipids. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with fumonisins inhibited incorporation of [14C]serine into the sphingosine moiety of cellular sphingolipids with an IC50 of 0.1 microM for fumonisin B1. In contrast, fumonisin B1 increased the amount of the biosynthetic intermediate sphinganine, which suggests that fumonisins inhibit the conversion of [14C]sphinganine to N-acyl-[14C]sphinganines, a step that is thought to precede introduction of the 4,5-trans double bond of sphingosine (Merrill, A.H., Jr. and Wang, E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3764-3769). In agreement with this mechanism, fumonisin B1 inhibited the activity of sphingosine N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthase) in rat liver microsomes with 50% inhibition at approximately 0.1 microM and reduced the conversion of [3H]sphingosine to [3H]ceramide by intact hepatocytes.

We propose that dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in establishing tolerance, especially in the periphery, after functioning T cells have been produced in the thymus. In the steady state, meaning in the absence of acute infection and inflammation, DCs are in an immature state and not fully differentiated to carry out their known roles as inducers of immunity. Nevertheless, immature DCs continuously circulate through tissues and into lymphoid organs, capturing self antigens as well as innocuous environmental proteins. Recent experiments have provided direct evidence that antigen-loaded immature DCs silence T cells either by deleting them or by expanding regulatory T cells. This capacity of DCs to induce peripheral tolerance can work in two opposing ways in the context of infection. In acute infection, a beneficial effect should occur. The immune system would overcome the risk of developing autoimmunity and chronic inflammation if, before infection, tolerance were induced to innocuous environmental proteins as well as self antigens captured from dying infected cells. For chronic or persistent pathogens, a second but dire potential could take place.

Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, among others, provided lists of all known studies.  Study Selection.  \u2014A total of 1264 articles or abstracts were reviewed for details on BCG vaccination, concurrent vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, and TB outcome; 70 articles were reviewed in depth for method of vaccine allocation used to create comparable groups, equal surveillance and follow-up for recipient and concurrent control groups, and outcome measures of TB cases and/or deaths. Fourteen prospective trials and 12 case-control studies were included in the analysis.  Data Extraction.  \u2014We recorded study design, age range of study population, number of patients enrolled, efficacy of vaccine, and items to assess the potential for bias in study design and diagnosis. At least two readers independently extracted data and evaluated validity.  Data Synthesis.  \u2014The relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of TB provided the measure of vaccine efficacy that we analyzed. The protective effect was then computed by 1 \u2014RR or 1 \u2014OR. A random-effects model estimated a weighted average RR or OR from those provided by the trials or case-control studies. In the trials, the RR of TB was 0.49 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.34 to 0.70) for vaccine recipients compared with nonrecipients (protective effect of 51%). In the case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.64), or a 50% protective effect. Seven trials reporting tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 71% (RR, 0.29; 95% Cl, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 64% (OR, 0.36; 95% Cl, 0.18 to 0.70). Geographic latitude of the study site and study validity score explained 66% of the heterogeneity among trials in a random-effects regression model.  Conclusion.  \u2014On average, BCG vaccine significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50%. Protection is observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG efficacy. Protection against tuberculous death, meningitis, and disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although this result may reflect reduced error in disease classification rather than greater BCG efficacy.

These T cells lost their ability to produce interferon \u03b3, IL-2, or IL-4 after several stimulations with immature DCs and differentiated into nonproliferating, IL-10\u2013producing T cells. Furthermore, in coculture experiments these T cells inhibited the antigen-driven proliferation of Th1 cells in a contact- and dose-dependent, but antigen-nonspecific manner.

Since tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we did a double-blind, randomised trial to assess the clinical benefit and safety of infliximab-a monoclonal antibody against TNF-\u03b1.  Methods  33 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomly assigned intravenous placebo (n=11), infliximab 5 mg/kg (n=11), or infliximab 10 mg/kg (n=11) at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients were assessed at week 10 for the primary endpoint (score on the physician's global assessment [PGA]). Analysis was by intention to treat.  Findings  Of the 33 patients enrolled, three dropped out. Nine of 11 (82%) patients in the infliximab 5 mg/kg group were responders (good, excellent, or clear rating on PGA), compared with two of 11 (18%) in the placebo group (difference 64% [95% CI 20\u201389], p=0\u00b70089), and ten of 11 (91%) patients in the infliximab 10 mg/kg group were responders (difference from placebo 73% [30-94], p=0\u00b70019). The median time to response was 4 weeks for patients in both infliximab groups. There were no serious adverse events, and infliximab was well tolerated.  Interpretation  In this controlled trial, patients receiving the anti-TNF-\u03b1 agent infliximab as monotherapy experienced a high degree of clinical benefit and rapid time to response in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis compared with patients who received placebo.

In some villages dracunculiasis undermines the health of at least 33% of the population at the same time--during the planting or harvest season. Further it is endemic in India Pakistan and 17 Sub-Saharan African countries.  The total number of cases is lower than epidemiologists assumed. Humans contract it by drinking stagnant water contaminated with copepods infected with guinea worm larvae. Adult female worms mature in humans in 1 year and emerge through the skin to deposit 1000s of larvae into the water where copepods ingest them. The 1st stage of the eradication campaign is a village by village search which involves mobilizing a large number of public health and other workers to visit all villages in the country over a period of 1-4 weeks to detect cases of dracunculiasis. The detailed data helps policymakers develop an elimination plan. The 2nd stage involves making it mandatory to report dracunculiasis cases and establishing village based monthly monitoring in villages know to have endemic dracunculiasis. At least 1 trained and supervised village resident is responsible for making monthly household visits record cases and report the data from the case register to the nearest primary health outpost each month. Case containment which originated in Pakistan in 1990 the 3rd stage begins when only a few cases remain in a country or subnational geographic area or when someone with dracunculiasis has been introduced into an area where it did not exist. This involves detecting each obvious case as soon as possible (e.g. 24 hours) to prevent further transmission. In India cash rewards motivate villagers to report obvious cases quickly.

We divided the cohort into two groups on the basis of the date of their follow-up examination: the study group consisted of 350 subjects who were seen after fortification (September 1997 to March 1998), and the control group consisted of 756 subjects who were seen before fortification (January 1995 to September 1996).

In that spirit, this paper studies microfabricated electrohydrodynamic fluid pumps. In electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping, fluid forces are generated by the interaction of electric fields and charges in the fluid. In contrast to forces generated by mechanical pumping using an impeller or bellows, EHD pumping requires no moving parts and consequently offers the possibility of simplified fabrication and high reliability.  This paper discusses electrohydrodynamic pumping and issues concerning its use in micronsize scale systems. The fundamental operating principles of the EHD pump are outlined and examples of configurations which meet the requirement for inducing free electric charge are shown. The possible performance achievable in micron size-scale regimes is indicated. Issues concerning fluid conductivity, instability and surface tension are addressed. A microfabricated structure which demonstrates the EHD pumping of a highly insulating silicone oil is described. The structure consists of an array of 10 \u03bcm by 235 \u03bcm highly doped, LPCVD polycrystalline silicon electrodes patterned over silicon nitride. The electrode array is excited with a traveling wave of electric potential. Pumping results are qualitatively described.  This paper describes a study of electrohydrodynamic pumping, including issues concerning its application to micron size-scale systems. The fundamental operating principles of EHD pumps are outlined and the possible performance achievable in micron size-scale regimes is indicated. Surface and bulk instabilities are addressed. Finally, the preliminary results of an EHD pumping experiment with a microfabricated structure are described.  A practical requirement for EHD pumping is the induction of free electric charge in the volume of the fluid to be pumped or on its interface with another material. Charge accumulation on a material interface is readily achievable; however, if one material is a fixed rigid wall, such as the wall of a conduit, no pumping can take place. Consequently, the practical application of microfabricated EHD pumps may require the induction of free charge in the volume of the fluid, possibly by temperature-induced conductivity gradients.  A further constraint on the usefulness of EHD pumping is its reduced effectiveness with conducting fluids. Hence its usefulness in many situations, including biological environments, may be limited. Another possible difficulty may be fluid instabilities; however, these instabilities may be useful for mixing and cooling purposes. Yet, it remains to be seen if they can compete with molecular diffusion in micron-size scale systems. Finally, it seems clear that surface tension will be a dominant force in virtually any micron-scale system with a liquid surface. In spite of these difficulties, electrohydrodynamic interactions may prove to be a reasonable way to achieve pumping without moving parts.", "date": " 1990 ", "authors": ["Stephen F. Bart", "Lee S.

For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-paramet'er exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption t'hat can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal wit'h maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder & Wedderburn (1972). This paper is mainly concerned wit'h fitting regression models, linear or nonlinear, in which the variance of each observation is specified to be either equal to, or proportional to, some function of its expectat'ion. If the form of distribution of the observations were specified, t'he method of maximum likelihood would give estimates of t'he parameters in t'he model. For instance, if it is specified that the observations have normally distributed errors with constant variance, then the method of least squares provides expressions for the variances and covariances of the estimates, exact for linear models and approximate for nonlinear ones, and these estimates and the expressions for their errors remain valid even if the observations are not normally distributed but merely have a fixed variance; thus, with linear models and a given error variance, the variance of least squares estimat'es is not affected by the distribution of the errors, and the same holds approximately for nonlinear ones. A more general situation is considered in this paper, namely the situation when there is a given relation between the variance and mean of the observations, possibly with an unknown constant of proportionality. A similar problem was considered from a Bayesian viewpoint by Hartigan (1969).We define a quasi-likelihood function, which can be used for estimation in the same way as a likelihood function. With constant variance this again leads to least squares estimation. When other mean-variance relationships are specified, the quasilikelihood sometimes turns out to be a recognizable likelihood function; for instance, for a constant coefficient of variation the quasi-likelihood function is the same as the likelihood obtained by treating the observations as if they had a gamma distribution.", "date": " 1974 ", "authors": ["R.

Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples.

A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995).

We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the \u2018hat\u2019 matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals.

Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of existing methods and overcomes some of their limitations. The authors' techniques can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance of the authors' model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed by Osher and Sethian (1988) to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a \"Hamilton-Jacobi\" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying upwind finite difference schemes. The authors present a variety of ways of computing the evolving front, including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low contrast medical images. >", "date": " 1995 ", "authors": ["R. Malladi", "J.A.

Antigenic site number determinations showed the positive haplotypes can be divided into 2 groups. Mice bearing the H-2b, H-2d, and H-2q haplotypes express a high number--40,000 to 80,000--of antigenic sites per B lymphocyte, and monoclonal antibody plus complement can lyse B cells from these mice.

Spleen cells from mice carrying the latter haplotypes are not lysed with monoclonal antibody and complement. Genetic mapping demonstrated that high and low expression map to the I-A and I-E subregions, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies detect an Ia specificity on I-Ab, I-Ad, I-Ed, and I-Ek molecules.

Upon priming, these cells develop into cells that produce either IFN gamma, TNF beta, and IL-2 or IL-4 and its congeners. The former cells are designated TH1-like, and the latter TH2-like. Here we review the regulation of the differentiation of naive CD4 cells into IFN gamma- or IL-4-producers. The dominant factors that determine such differentiation are lymphokines and other cytokines. IL-2 itself appears to be required for naive cells to develop into TH1- or TH2-like cells but is not deterministic of their differentiation fate. If IL-4 is also present during the priming period, the resultant CD4+ T cells produce IL-4 upon restimulation; the development of IFN gamma-producing cells is strikingly inhibited by IL-4. In the absence of IL-4, priming for IFN gamma-production occurs, but this is markedly enhanced by IL-12. The role of IFN gamma in enhancing priming for IFN gamma-production is not fully resolved. In some in vitro systems, it appears to act together with IL-12 to enhance such production. Anti-IFN gamma diminishes priming for IFN gamma production in vivo. Lymphokines also exert a \"cross-regulatory\" or inhibitory effect. As noted above, IL-4 strikingly diminishes priming for IFN gamma production, although this inhibitory effect is blunted in the presence of IL-12. IFN gamma similarly diminishes priming for IL-4 production; this effect is principally observed when low concentrations of IL-4 are used in the priming culture. Although other factors may play a role in the determination of lymphokine-producing phenotype, such as antigen dose, type of antigen-presenting cell, and expression of accessory molecules and hormones, these effects appear to be secondary to the dominant role of the lymphokines and cytokines.", "date": " 1994 ", "authors": ["R A Seder", "W E Paul"], "related_topics": ["priming (immunology)", "lymphokine", "cellular differentiation", "antigen", "tumor necrosis factor alpha", "t lymphocyte", "in vitro", "cell", "cell biology", "immunology", "biology", "animals", "antigen-presenting cells / physiology"], "citation_count": "2,304", "reference_count": "0", "references": ["2142017607", "2107369528", "2031501484", "2156451877", "1967261754", "2122939321", "2114216755", "1972922050", "2134768631", "1991464867"]}, {"id": "2029860358", "title": "Stat6 Is Required for Mediating Responses to IL-4 and for the Development of Th2 Cells", "abstract": "Summary Kopf et al., 1993).

Interleukin (IL) 12 suppresses the expression of Th2 cytokines and their associated responses, including eosinophilia, serum immunoglobulin E, and mucosal mastocytosis. We have previously shown in a murine model that antigen-induced increases in airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary eosinophilia are CD4+ T cell dependent. We used this model to determine the ability of IL-12 to prevent antigen-induced increases in airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophils, and lung Th2 cytokine expression. Sensitized A/J mice developed airway hyperresponsiveness and increased numbers of BAL eosinophils and other inflammatory cells after single or repeated intratracheal challenges with sheep red blood cell antigen. Pulmonary mRNA and protein levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 were increased after antigen challenge. Administration of IL-12 (1 microgram/d x 5 d) at the time of a single antigen challenge abolished the airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary eosinophilia and promoted an increase in interferon (IFN) gamma and decreases in IL-4 and IL-5 expression. The effects of IL-12 were partially dependent on IFN-gamma, because concurrent treatment with IL-12 and anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody partially reversed the inhibition of airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia by IL-12. Treatment of mice with IL-12 at the time of a second antigen challenge also prevented airway hyperresponsiveness and significantly reduced numbers of BAL inflammatory cells, reflecting the ability of IL-12 to inhibit responses associated with ongoing antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation.

Human studies have correlated aberrant activation of T helper (Th) 2-like effector systems in the airways with disease. A murine model of airway hyperreactivity in response to acetylcholine was established using mice immunized with ovalbumin and challenged with aerosolized antigen. No airway hyperractivity occurred in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Identically immunized BALB/c mice developed an influx of cells, with a predominance of eosinophils and CD4+ T cells, into the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the time that substantial changes in airway pressure and resistance were quantitated. Challenged animals developed marked increases in Th2 cytokine production, eosinophil influx, and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Neutralization of interleukin (IL) 4 using monoclonal antibodies administered during the period of systemic immunization abrogated airway hyperractivity but had little effect on the influx of eosinophils. Administration of anti-IL-4 only during the period of the aerosol challenge did not affect the subsequent response to acetylcholine. Finally, administration of anti-IL-5 antibodies at levels that suppressed eosinophils to < 1% of recruited cells had no effect on the subsequent airway responses.

IL-4 is required for the generation of both primary polyclonal and secondary antigen-specific IgE responses in vivo. 2. IL-4 is required to maintain established, ongoing, antigen-specific and polyclonal IgE responses. 3. Most, but not all, polyclonal IgE production during a secondary immune response is IL-4-dependent. Memory B cells that have already switched to IgE at the DNA level may no longer require stimulation with IL-4 to be induced to secrete IgE. 4. The generation of a secondary IgE response is not dependent upon the presence of IL-4 during primary immunization. However, if IL-4 is not present during primary immunization, it is required during secondary immunization for the generation of an IgE response. 5. IL-4 does not appear to be required for the generation of in vivo IgG1 responses, and in at least some instances, does not contribute significantly to the generation of IgG1 responses in vivo. 6. A late-acting form of T-cell help other than IL-4 appears to be required for the generation of an IgE, but not an IgG1 response. 7. An antibody that inhibits IL-4 binding to IL-4 receptors affects Ig isotype selection in the same way as an antibody that neutralizes IL-4. 8. IFN-gamma can act in both spontaneous and induced immune responses to suppress IgE production. 9. IFN-gamma can also suppress IgG1 production and stimulate IgG2a production. However, IFN-gamma appears to suppress polyclonal IgG1 responses more than antigen-specific IgG1 responses, and it enhances, but is not required for, the generation of IgG2a responses. 10. IFN-alpha appears to resemble IFN-gamma in its ability to inhibit IgE and enhance IgG2a responses in GaM delta-injected mice, but it requires the presence of IFN-gamma to suppress IgG1 production in these mice. 11. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma appear to be able to decrease IgE production in some human patients. 12.

Roles for interferon-y (IFN-y), interleukin 12 (IL-12), and IL-4 in Thl and Th2 maturation have been demonstrated, although additional undefined signals are required. Study of the genetically susceptible BALB/c mouse has shown fail\u00ad ure to downmodulate IL-4 production in response to infection, a response that is critically associated with the failure to develop appropriate Thl responses.

Studies in animal models have revealed that T lymphocytes and the cytokines they produce play a crucial role in determining the outcome of parasitic infection in terms of both protective immunity and immunopathology. Of particular interest is recent evidence that different parasitic infections in the context of different host genetic background can trigger polarized CD4+ T cell subset responses. The set of cytokines produced by these different T helper responses, in turn, can have opposing effects on the parasite, resulting in either control of infection or promotion of disease. Moreover, cytokines produced by one CD4+ subset can block either the production and/or activity of the cytokines produced by the other subset. The establishment of this state of cross-regulation may be important for parasite survival. CD8+ T cells also appear to play a dual effector/regulatory role in parasite immunity and immunopathology, although the mechanisms underlying their induction and function are less well understood. CD(8+)-mediated cytolytic killing functions have now been demonstrated against a number of different intracellular protozoa, although IFN-gamma produced by the same effector cells may also be critical in host community.

Cells harvested from spleens of mice injected with anti-CD3 90 min earlier secreted IL-4, IL-2, and IFN-gamma without further stimulation. By contrast, in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 of spleen cell suspensions or splenic fragments from noninjected donors failed to cause prompt production of IL-4 and, even after 24 h of stimulation, the amount of IL-4 produced in such cells was substantially less than that secreted within 1 h by spleen cell suspensions or splenic fragments from mice injected with anti-CD3 90 min earlier.

Elevated H2O2 release in response to PMA was observed in resident macrophages after a 48-h incubation with IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, or CSF-GM. Of these, only IFN-gamma induced substantial NO2- secretion during the culture period. The cytokines inactive in both assays under the conditions tested were IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, CSF-M, and transforming growth factor-beta 1. Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma for 48 h in the presence of LPS inhibited H2O2 production but augmented NO2- release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog NG-monomethylarginine inhibited NO2- release but not H2O2 production. Although neither TNF-alpha nor TNF-beta induced NO2- synthesis on its own, addition of either cytokine together with IFN-gamma increased macrophage NO2- production up to six-fold over that in macrophages treated with IFN-gamma alone. Moreover, IFN-alpha or IFN-beta in combination with LPS could also induce NO2- production in macrophages, as was previously reported for IFN-gamma plus LPS. These data suggest that: 1) tested as a sole agent, IFN-gamma was the only one of the 12 cytokines capable of inducing both NO2- and H2O2 release; 2) the pathways leading to secretion of H2O2 and NO2- are independent; 3) either IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha/beta or IFN-alpha/beta/gamma and LPS can interact synergistically to induce NO2- release.", "date": " 1988 ", "authors": ["A.

Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex.

DC from conventional, germ-free, and specific pathogen-free mice were all rich in Ia.

The PI3 kinase from cell lysates bound to the wild-type receptor but not to a mutant receptor that had a deletion of the kinase insert region. A protein of an apparent size of 85 kDa bound to the receptor, consistent with previous observations that a protein of this size is associated with PI3 kinase activity.

A 20-amino-acid peptide composed of a sequence in the kinase insert region that included one of the autophosphorylation sites of the receptor (tyrosine 719) as well as a nearby tyrosine (Y708) blocked the binding of PI3 kinase to the receptor, but only when the peptide was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues.

The relative location of each fragment in the T7 DNA has been determined by a combination of techniques. If it is assumed that the length of any DNA molecule equals the sum of the lengths of the fragments produced from it by cleavage, and that electrophoretic mobility through agarose gels is a smooth function of the length of the DNA, then the known relationships between fragments provide enough conditions to define accurately the relative molecular weight of each fragment in the set. Absolute molecular weights are based on that of full-length T7 DNA. The fragments provide a convenient set of length standards covering the entire range from about 100 to 40,000 base-pairs (the length of T7 DNA).  A horizontal slab gel system for electrophoresis on agarose gels is described. In this system, gels of very low concentrations do not distort during electrophoresis and accurate relative mobilities of large DNAs are obtained. Excellent resolution can be obtained for DNAs of molecular weights up to at least 26\u00b75\u00d7106, a difference of less than 10% being readily resolved even for molecules of this size.  Agarose and polyacrylamide gels can be prepared in alkaline solvents that denature native DNA and completely unfold the single strands. The fragments of T7 DNA have the same relative mobilities whether subjected to electrophoresis as single strands in alkaline gels or as double-stranded DNA in neutral gels, and resolution is comparable in the two states. Thus, electrophoresis in alkaline gels can provide accurate molecular weights for linear, single-stranded DNAs, and should be useful in analyzing DNA for single-strand breaks, depurinations or topological differences such as ring forms.  In both neutral and alkaline gels, the relative mobilities of DNAs shorter than about 1000 base-pairs (or bases) are essentially insensitive to changes in voltage gradient, at least over the range of voltage gradients commonly employed. However, relative mobilities become increasingly sensitive to voltage gradient the larger the DNA, with DNAs longer than about 20,000 base-pairs (or bases) being severely affected. This effect is probably due to the ease with which large DNA molecules can be deformed from their equilibrium conformations, thus permitting them to penetrate channels in the gel that would exclude them in their unperturbed conformations.

A PtdIns kinase activity has been found to associate specifically with several oncogene products, as well as with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor5\u20138. We have previously identified two biochemically distinct PtdIns kinases in fibroblasts, and have found that only one of these, designated type I, specifically associates with activated tyrosine kinases7. We have now characterized the site on the inositol ring phosphorylated by type I PtdIns kinase, and find that this kinase specifically phosphorylates the D-3 ring position to generate a novel phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). In contrast, the main PtdIns kinase in fibroblasts, designated type II, specifically phosphorylates the D-4 position to produce phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), previously considered to be the only form of PtdInsP (ref. 9).

This strategy can be used with single-stranded phage, plasmid, and synthetic RNA-plasmid systems. The reagents that are used are inexpensive and readily available. The chapter illustrates a figure that outlines the steps involved in generating the ordered sets of deletion breakpoints for DNA sequencing. The method is based on a series of enzymatic treatments of a segment of DNA cloned into a suitable vector. Cloning efficiencies are sufficiently high that standard Ca2+ treated cells are adequate for transfection or transformation. Exonuclease III is an incompletely processive nuclease. The rate of exonuclease III is very sensitive to the temperature of incubation. The procedure described in the chapter has several advantages.

Furthermore, about 80% of the cDNA clones of both libraries whose sequence matched with known genes had the known 5' ends or sequences upstream of the known 5' ends (28 out of 35 for the full length-enriched library and 51 out of 62 for the 5'-end-enriched library). The longest full-length clone of the full length-enriched cDNA library was about 3300 bp (among 28 clones). In contrast, seven clones (out of the 51 clones with the mRNA start sites) from the 5'-end-enriched cDNA library came from mRNAs whose length is more than 3500 bp.

Prob- lems that have puzzled scientists for centuries seem to be moving tom the realm of abstract philosophy towards practical solo ution. The power of recombinant DNA technology fuels this opti- mism; at last genes can be engineered, inserted, located, monitored, neutralized and their impact on development asses- sed. The prospect of interfering positively, rather than randomly, with the genetic basis for development is real. The prac- tical basis for this optimism, as recorded in this manual, is clearly well founded. It is impressive that so much pro- gress in the genetic manipulation of the mouse has been made so rapidly. Here are recorded the tech- niques for preparing, inserting and analysing DNA sequences, for retroviral infection of em- bryos, for production and use of EC and EK cells as vehicles for engineered sequences and for nuclear transplantation - all this against a background of the basic procedures required for pro- ducing and handling the em- bryos. If there is one critidsm, it is that the format and content of manual do reveal a fashionable, but perhaps a rather narrow, belief that it is by gene injection (or variants of it) alone that the problem of development will be solved.

The insertion of A or G occurs most efficiently at the abasic lesion when T is the 5'-nearest neighbor on the primer strand and least efficiently when G is the 5'-nearest neighbor.

Among the various techniques described in the literature, evaporation and condensation processes are favored for their simplicity and high-quality products, but these gas-phase approaches generally require economically prohibitive temperatures of 800\u2013900 8C. Despite recent MOCVD schemes that reduced the deposition temperature to 450 8C by using organometallic zinc precursors, the commercial potential of gas-phase-grown ZnO nanowires remains constrained by the expensive and/or insulating (for example, Al2O3) substrates required for oriented growth, as well as the size and cost of the vapor deposition systems. A low-temperature, large-scale, and versatile synthetic process is needed before ZnO nanowire arrays find realistic applications in solar energy conversion, light emission, and other promising areas. Solution approaches to ZnO nanowires are appealing because of their low growth temperatures and good potential for scale-up. In this regard, Vayssieres et al. developed a hydrothermal process for producing arrays of ZnO microrods and nanorods on conducting glass substrates at 95 8C. Recently, a seeded growth process was used to make helical ZnO rods and columns at a similar temperature. Here we expand on these synthetic methods to produce homogeneous and dense arrays of ZnO nanowires that can be grown on arbitrary substrates under mild aqueous conditions. We present data for arrays on four-inch (ca. 10 cm) silicon wafers and two-inch plastic substrates, which demonstrate the ease of commercial scale-up. The simple two-step procedure yields oriented nanowire films with the largest surface area yet reported for nanowire arrays. The growth process ensures that a majority of the nanowires in the array are in direct contact with the substrate and provide a continuous pathway for carrier transport, an important feature for future electronic devices based on these materials. Well-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays were grown using a simple two-step process. In the first step, ZnO nanocrystals (5\u201310 nm in diameter) were spin-cast several times onto a four-inch Si(100) wafer to form a 50\u2013200-nm thick film of crystal seeds. Between coatings, the wafer was annealed at 150 8C to ensure particle adhesion to the wafer surface. The ZnO nanocrystals were prepared according to the method of Pacholski. A NaOH solution in methanol (0.03m) was added slowly to a solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (0.01m) in methanol at 60 8C and stirred for two hours. The resulting nanoparticles are spherical and stable for at least two weeks in solution. After uniformly coating the silicon wafer with ZnO nanocrystals, hydrothermal ZnO growth was carried out by suspending the wafer upside-down in an open crystallizing dish filled with an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hydrate (0.025m) and methenamine or diethylenetriamine (0.025m) at 90 8C. Reaction times spanned from 0.5 to 6 h. The wafer was then removed from solution, rinsed with deionized water, and dried. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used to examine the morphology of the nanowire array across the entire wafer, while single nanowires were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nanowire crystallinity and growth direction were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction techniques. SEM images taken of several four-inch samples showed that the entire wafer was coated with a highly uniform and densely packed array of ZnO nanowires (Figure 1). X-ray diffraction (not shown) gave a wurtzite ZnO pattern with an enhanced (002) peak resulting from the vertical orientation of the nanowires.

AP sites obstruct in vitro DNA synthesis catalyzed by E. coli pol I. The position at which termination of synthesis occurs was determined for four enzymes. T4 DNA polymerase terminates one nucleotide before putative AP sites. DNA pol I, AMV reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase alpha terminate synthesis either before or at the site of an AP lesion depending on the particular sequence. We determined the identity of the nucleotide inserted opposite an AP site by synthesizing up to the lesion in a first-stage reaction using T4 DNA polymerase and then determining elongation in a second stage. Purines are inserted opposite AP sites more readily than pyrimidines, and dATP is more efficient than dGTP in promoting such elongation.

DNA sequence analyses of 460 independent mutants resulting from this error-prone DNA synthesis demonstrate a wide variety of mutational events. Frameshift and base substitutions are made at approximately equal frequency and together comprise about 90% of all mutations. Two mutational \"hot spots\" for frameshift and base substitution mutations were observed. The characteristics of the mutations at these sites suggest that certain base substitution errors result from dislocation of template bases rather than from direct mispair formation by DNA polymerase-beta. When considering the entire target sequence, single-base frameshift mutations occur primarily in runs of identical bases, usually pyrimidines. The loss of a single base occurs 20-80 times more frequently than single-base additions and much more frequently than the loss of two or more bases. Base substitutions occur at many sites throughout the target, representing a wide spectrum of mispair formations. Averaged over a large number of phenotypically detectable sites, the base substitution error frequency is greater than one mistake for every 5000 bases polymerized. Large deletion mutations are also observed, at a frequency more than 10-fold over background, indicating that purified DNA polymerases alone are capable of producing such deletions.

Criteria used are the insecticidal spectra and the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins. Fourteen genes are distinguished, encoding proteins active against either Lepidoptera (cryI), Lepidoptera and Diptera (cryII), Coleoptera (cryIII), or Diptera (cryIV). One gene, cytA, encodes a general cytolytic protein and shows no structural similarities with the other genes. Toxicity studies with single purified proteins demonstrated that every described crystal protein is characterized by a highly specific, and sometimes very restricted, insect host spectrum. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences reveals sequence elements which are conserved for Cry proteins. The expression of crystal protein genes is affected by a number of factors. Recently, two distinct sigma subunits regulating transcription during different stages of sporulation have been identified, as well as a protein regulating the expression of a crystal protein at a posttranslational level. Studies on the biochemical mechanisms of toxicity suggest that B. thuringiensis crystal proteins induce the formation of pores in membranes of susceptible cells. In vitro binding studies with radiolabeled toxins demonstrated a strong correlation between the specificity of B. thuringiensis toxins and the interaction with specific binding sites on the insect midgut epithelium.

T7 RNA polymerase is highly selective for its own promoters, which do not occur naturally in Escherichia coli. A relatively small amount of T7 RNA polymerase provided from a cloned copy of T7 gene 1 is sufficient to direct high-level transcription from a T7 promoter in a multicopy plasmid. Such transcription can proceed several times around the plasmid without terminating, and can be so active that transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase is greatly decreased. When a cleavage site for RNase III is introduced, discrete RNAs of plasmid length can accumulate. The natural transcription terminator from T7 DNA also works effectively in the plasmid. Both the rate of synthesis and the accumulation of RNA directed by T7 RNA polymerase can reach levels comparable with those for ribosomal RNAs in a normal cell. These high levels of accumulation suggest that the RNAs are relatively stable, perhaps in part because their great length and/or stem-and-loop structures at their 3' ends help to protect them against exonucleolytic degradation. It seems likely that a specific mRNA produced by T7 RNA polymerase can rapidly saturate the translational machinery of E. coli, so that the rate of protein synthesis from such an mRNA will depend primarily on the efficiency of its translation. When the mRNA is efficiently translated, a target protein can accumulate to greater than 50% of the total cell protein in three hours or less. We have used two ways to deliver active T7 RNA polymerase to the cell; infection by a lambda derivative that carries gene 1, or induction of a chromosomal copy of gene 1 under control of the lacUV5 promoter. When gene 1 is delivered by infection, very toxic target genes can be maintained silent in the cell until T7 RNA polymerase is introduced, when they rapidly become expressed at high levels. When gene 1 is resident in the chromosome, even the very low basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase present in the uninduced cell can prevent the establishment of plasmids carrying toxic target genes, or make the plasmid unstable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "date": " 1986 ", "authors": ["F W Studier", "B A Moffatt"], "related_topics": ["t7 rna polymerase", "rna-dependent rna polymerase", "rna polymerase i", "polymerase", "rna polymerase", "rna polymerase ii", "transcription (biology)", "sigma factor", "molecular biology", "biology", "cloning, molecular", "dna-directed rna polymerases / genetics *"], "citation_count": "9,483", "reference_count": "27", "references": ["2090920017", "1973241521", "2071424950", "2027393724", "2002841189", "1966648387", "2042233418", "2013002258", "2083611131", "2011545144"]}, {"id": "2034491150", "title": "Animal cytology and evolution.", "abstract": null, "date": " 1977 ", "authors": ["M.

Bt-protected corn, cotton, and potato were introduced into the United States in 1995/1996 and grown on a total of approximately 10 million acres in 1997, 20 million acres in 1998, and 29 million acres globally in 1999. The extremely rapid adoption of these Bt-protected crops demonstrates the outstanding grower satisfaction of the performance and value of these products. These crops provide highly effective control of major insect pests such as the European corn borer, southwestern corn borer, tobacco budworm, cotton bollworm, pink bollworm, and Colorado potato beetle and reduce reliance on conventional chemical pesticides. They have provided notably higher yields in cotton and corn. The estimated total net savings to the grower using Bt-protected cotton in the United States was approximately $92 million in 1998. Other benefits of these crops include reduced levels of the fungal toxin fumonisin in corn and the opportunity for supplemental pest control by beneficial insects due to the reduced use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Insect resistance management plans are being implemented to ensure the prolonged effectiveness of these products. Extensive testing of Bt-protected crops has been conducted which establishes the safety of these products to humans, animals, and the environment. Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicology studies conducted over the past 40 years establish the safety of the microbial Bt products, including their expressed insecticidal (Cry) proteins, which are fully approved for marketing. Mammalian toxicology and digestive fate studies, which have been conducted with the proteins produced in the currently approved Bt-protected plant products, have confirmed that these Cry proteins are nontoxic to humans and pose no significant concern for allergenicity. Food and feed derived from Bt-protected crops which have been fully approved by regulatory agencies have been shown to be substantially equivalent to the food and feed derived from conventional crops. Nontarget organisms exposed to high levels of Cry protein are virtually unaffected, except for certain insects that are closely related to the target pests. Because the Cry protein is contained within the plant (in microgram quantities), the potential for exposure to farm workers and nontarget organisms is extremely low. The Cry proteins produced in Bt-protected crops have been shown to rapidly degrade when crop residue is incorporated into the soil. Thus the environmental impact of these crops is negligible.

Restriction enzyme digestion within a region homologous to yeast chromosomal DNA greatly enhances the efficiency of integration. Furthermore, if two restriction cuts are made within the same homologous sequence, thereby removing an internal segment of DNA, the resulting deleted-linear molecules are still able to transform at a high frequency.

The final structure is identical to that obtained from integration of a circular molecule. The integration of linear and gapped-linear molecules, but not of circular molecules, is blocked by the rad52-1 mutation.

One candidate property is stability to digestion. We have systematically evaluated the stability of food allergens that are active via the gastrointestinal tract in a simple model of gastric digestion, emphasizing the major allergens of plant-derived foods such as legumes (peanuts and soybean). Important food allergens were stable to digestion in the gastric model (simulated gastric fluid). For example, soybean s-conglycinin was stable for 60 min. In contrast, nonallergenic food proteins, such as spinach ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, were digested in simulated gastric fluid within 15 sec.

The values estimated from the retardation times for the molecular weights of the largest molecules ranged from about 20\u00d7109 to 80\u00d7109 daltons depending on the species of Drosophila. The molecular weights of the DNA molecules were independent of the metaphase shapes (i.e., metacentric or submetacentric), but were proportional to the DNA contents of the chromosomes in the case of translocations or deletions. It was concluded, therefore, that the DNA molecules must run the length of the chromosome and cannot be discontinuous at the centromere. When compared with the values of the DNA contents of Drosophila chromosomes determined by other methods, the results were consistent with the model of one, or possibly two, DNA molecules per chromosome; the simplest conclusion, that there is only one DNA molecule per chromosome (for simple chromosomes), rests on a long extrapolation of an empirical relation between retardation time and molecular weight, but is also favored by indirect evidence. Further possibilities which could not be excluded were that the large DNA molecules contained Pronase-resistant, non-DNA links, or that a fraction of smaller DNA molecules might also have been present in the chromosomes.

We integrated the experimental mutational signatures with data from newly sequenced HCCs from Qidong County, China, a region of well-studied aflatoxin exposure. This indicated that COSMIC mutational signature 24, previously hypothesized to stem from aflatoxin exposure, indeed likely represents AFB1 exposure, possibly combined with other exposures. Among published somatic mutation data, we found evidence of AFB1 exposure in 0.7% of HCCs treated in North America, 1% of HCCs from Japan, but 16% of HCCs from Hong Kong.

It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result.

When isolating nuclei by differential centrifugation, the above principles led to the selection of some methods which have been recently discussed [l]. Those proposed by Hogeboom, Schneider and Striebich [2] and by Dounce [ 1 ] showed clearly that the contamination of the nuclei by cytoplasmic structures is one of the main difficulties encountered in the isolation of the nuclear fraction. Indeed intact cells, mitochondria, connective tissue and erythrocytes may be found in this fraction, and their presence, even in very small quantities, has an important effect on the nuclear composition. The calculations show that the method of Hogeboom et al., which leaves in the nuclear fraction < 1 per cent of intact cells and < 0.5 per cent of mitochondria of the initial homogenate, gives nuclei in which about 8.5 per cent of nitrogen is of extranuclear origin [a]. If we consider the principle of differential centrifugation which is based on the sedimentation rates, it is obvious that this contamination is theoretically impossible to avoid, since all the particles migrate in the same direction. Purification can only be made by washing several times and by using processes such as double perfusion of the liver, filtration of the homogenate, use of CaCl,, adjustment of pH, etc. [l, 21. Despite these precautions, intact cells and mitochondria can never be completely eliminated and an accurate count of contaminants is necessary, especially in the study of the nuclear composition [a]. On the other hand, the use of the differences of density between the particles enables a complete separation to be made, since only particles having a density higher than that of the medium sediment out during the centrifugation, while the others migrate in the opposite direction.

Within the trichothecene group, deoxynivalenol (DON) is widely associated with feed rejection in pigs, while T-2 toxin can precipitate reproductive disturbances in sows. Another group comprising zearalenone (ZEN) and its derivatives is endowed with oestrogenic properties. The third category includes the fumonisins which have been linked with specific toxicity syndromes such as equine leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM) and porcine pulmonary oedema. Many toxigenic species of Fusarium are also common pathogens of cereal plants, causing diseases such as head blight of wheat and barley and ear rot of maize. Consequently, when cereal plants are infected with these fungi, there is a risk that grain may become contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins and that these may subsequently be transferred to compound feeds. The surveillance of grain and animal feed for the occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins continues to attract worldwide attention and has been the subject of extensive investigations over recent years. For example, high incidence rates of contamination with DON and another trichothecene, nivalenol (NIV), have been reported in maize samples in New Zealand. In Poland, unacceptably high values (up to 927\u00a0mg/kg) for DON were recorded for maize grain and cobs. Potentially harmful levels of DON (up to 40\u00a0mg/kg) were also observed in wheat produced in Germany, Poland, Japan, New Zealand, USA, Canada and Argentina. Samples of barley grain in Norway, Japan and USA were found with DON levels of up to 71\u00a0mg/kg. In the Norwegian study oat samples were also contaminated with DON at levels ranging from 7 to 62\u00a0mg/kg grain. Abnormally high concentrations of both NIV and ZEN have been observed in some Japanese barley samples (up to 26 and 15\u00a0mg/kg, respectively), and in maize produced in New Zealand (up to 7 and 10.5\u00a0mg/kg, respectively). Other trichothecenes such as 3-acetyl DON, diacetyoxyscirpenol (DAS), T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin have also been found in cereals and animal feed in both temperate and tropical countries. In Uruguay all samples of maize-based animal feeds tested were positive for fumonisin B1 (FB1). However, highest FB1 values were observed in South Africa for compound feed (11\u2008000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg), and in Thailand and China for maize (18\u2008800 and 25\u2008970\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, respectively). In a study of Argentinian maize, FB2 was the major fumonisin at values of up to 11\u2008300\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. An alarming feature of several surveys is that in the tropics in particular, several Fusarium mycotoxins may co-occur with each other and with aflatoxin B1, an Aspergillus compound sharing carcinogenic properties with fumonisins. It is concluded that, although sample size has been small in a number of surveys, there is nevertheless unequivocal evidence of global contamination of cereal grains and animal feed with several trichothecenes, ZEN and fumonisins. Furthermore, it is clear that legislation for the control of these mycotoxins in animal feed is now overdue and that further work is required to exploit cereal genotypes that are resistant to diseases caused by toxigenic Fusarium phytopathogens.", "date": " 1999 ", "authors": ["C.M Placinta", "J.P.F D'Mello", "A.M.C Macdonald"], "related_topics": ["mycotoxins in animal feed", "zearalenone", "trichothecene", "fumonisin b1", "fumonisin", "fusarium", "animal feed", "fusarium langsethiae", "toxicology", "botany", "biology"], "citation_count": "1,179", "reference_count": "57", "references": ["6409483", "607295538", "2142029901", "2046184978", "2095621787", "316363525", "639688165", "2068022249", "2017042190", "1973197874"]}, {"id": "2075793367", "title": "Hepatitis B virus integration in a cyclin A gene in a hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "HEPATITIS B virus (HBV) DNA frequently integrates into the genome of human primary liver cancer cells1\u20134, but the significance of this integration in liver carcinogenesis is still unclear.

This region contains the gene for the transformation-associated protein p53. Southern and Northern blot hybridization experiments provided no evidence for gross alterations of the p53 gene or surrounding sequences. As a more rigorous test of the possibility that p53 was a target of the deletions, the p53 coding regions from two tumors were analyzed; these two tumors, like most colorectal carcinomas, had allelic deletions of chromosome 17p and expressed considerable amounts of p53 messenger RNA from the remaining allele. The remaining p53 allele was mutated in both tumors, with an alanine substituted for valine at codon 143 of one tumor and a histidine substituted for arginine at codon 175 of the second tumor. Both mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene that was previously found to be mutated in murine p53 oncogenes.

Originally considered to be an oncogene, several convergent lines of research have indicated that the wild-type gene product actually functions as a tumour suppressor gene. For example, expression of the neoplastic phenotype is inhibited, rather than promoted, when rat cells are transfected with the murine wild-type p53 gene together with mutant p53 genes and/or other oncogenes. Moreover, in human tumours, the short arm of chromosome 17 is often deleted. In colorectal cancers, the smallest common region of deletion is centred at 17p13.1; this region harbours the p53 gene, and in two tumours examined in detail, the remaining (non-deleted) p53 alleles were found to contain mutations. This result was provocative because allelic deletion coupled with mutation of the remaining allele is a theoretical hallmark of tumour-suppressor genes. In the present report, we have attempted to determine the generality of this observation; that is, whether tumours with allelic deletions of chromosome 17p contain mutant p53 genes in the allele that is retained. Our results suggest that (1) most tumours with such allelic deletions contain p53 point mutations resulting in amino-acid substitutions, (2) such mutations are not confined to tumours with allelic deletion, but also occur in at least some tumours that have retained both parental 17p alleles, and (3) p53 gene mutations are clustered in four 'hot-spots' which exactly coincide with the four most highly conserved regions of the gene.

In humans, biotransformation of AFB1 to the putative carcinogenic intermediate. AFB-8,9-exo-epoxide, occurs predominantly by cytochromes P450 1A2 and 3A4, with the relative importance of each dependent upon the relative magnitude of expression of the respective enzymes in liver. Genetic variability in the expression of these and other cytochromes P450 may result in substantial interindividual differences in susceptibility to the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxins. Detoxification of AFB-8,9-epoxide by a specific alpha class glutathione S-transferase is an important protective mechanism in mice, and it accounts for the resistance of this species to the carcinogenic effects of AFB. This particular form of GST is expressed constitutively only at low levels in rats, but it is inducible by antioxidants such as ethoxyquin, and it accounts for much of the chemoprotective effects of a variety of substances, including natural dietary components that putatively act via an \"antioxidant response element\" (ARE). In humans, the constitutively expressed GSTs have very little activity toward AFB1-8,9-exo-epoxide, suggesting that--on a biochemical basis--humans should be quite sensitive to the genotoxic effects of aflatoxins. If a gene encoding a high aflatoxin-active form of GST is present in the human genome, but is not constitutively expressed, and is inducible by dietary antioxidants (as occurs in rats), then chemo- and/or dietary intervention measures aimed at inducing this enzyme could be highly effective. However, as it is possible that human CYP 1A2 may also be inducible by these same chemicals (because of the possible presence of an ARE in this gene), the ultimate consequence of dietary treatment with chemicals that induce biotransformation enzymes via an ARE is uncertain. The balance of the rate of activation (exo-epoxide production) to inactivation (GST conjugation plus other P450-mediated non-epoxide oxidations) may be a strong indicator of individual and species susceptibility to aflatoxin carcinogenesis, if the experimental conditions are reflective of true dietary exposures. There is strong evidence that AFB-8,9-exo-epoxide binds to G:C rich regions of DNA, forming an adduct at the N7-position of guanine. Substantial evidence demonstrates that AFB1-8,9-epoxide can induce activating mutations in the ras oncogene in experimental animals, primarily at codon 12.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "date": " 1994 ", "authors": ["D L Eaton", "Evan P.

Results: Tumors could be divided into 2 groups according to chromosome stability status. In the first group, demonstrating a chromosome stability, b-catenin mutation associated with chromosome 8p losses were frequently found as the single genetic alterations. b-catenin mutations were associated with large tumor size and with negative hepatitis B virus status. In the second group, demonstrating a chromosome instability, the most frequent allelic losses were on chromosome 1p, 4q, 6q, 9p, 13q, 16p, 16q, and 17p; Axin1 and p53 were frequently mutated. All of these alterations, except losses on 6q and 9p, were associated with hepatitis B virus infection. P53 mutations, 17p, 13q losses, and a high value of the fractional allelic loss index were associated with poor differentiated tumors, independently of risk factors.

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.", "date": " 2012 ", "authors": ["Jesse R Dixon", "Siddarth Selvaraj", "Feng Yue", "Audrey Kim", "Yan-Yan Li", "Yin-Zhong Shen", "Ming Hu", "Jun S.

Sequencing of phenotyped clinical subjects will soon become a method of choice in studies of the genetic causes of Mendelian and complex diseases. New exon capture techniques will direct sequencing efforts towards the most informative and easily interpretable protein-coding fraction of the genome. Thus, the demand for computational predictions of the impact of protein sequence variants will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nHere we present a new method and the corresponding software tool, PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), which is different from the early tool PolyPhen1 in the set of predictive features, alignment pipeline, and the method of classification (Fig. 1a). PolyPhen-2 uses eight sequence-based and three structure-based predictive features (Supplementary Table 1) which were selected automatically by an iterative greedy algorithm (Supplementary Methods). Majority of these features involve comparison of a property of the wild-type (ancestral, normal) allele and the corresponding property of the mutant (derived, disease-causing) allele, which together define an amino acid replacement. Most informative features characterize how well the two human alleles fit into the pattern of amino acid replacements within the multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins, how distant the protein harboring the first deviation from the human wild-type allele is from the human protein, and whether the mutant allele originated at a hypermutable site2. The alignment pipeline selects the set of homologous sequences for the analysis using a clustering algorithm and then constructs and refines their multiple alignment (Supplementary Fig. 1). The functional significance of an allele replacement is predicted from its individual features (Supplementary Figs. 2\u20134) by Naive Bayes classifier (Supplementary Methods).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\nPolyPhen-2 pipeline and prediction accuracy. (a) Overview of the algorithm. (b) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predictions made by PolyPhen-2 using five-fold cross-validation on HumDiv (red) and HumVar3 (light green). UniRef100 (solid ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe used two pairs of datasets to train and test PolyPhen-2. We compiled the first pair, HumDiv, from all 3,155 damaging alleles with known effects on the molecular function causing human Mendelian diseases, present in the UniProt database, together with 6,321 differences between human proteins and their closely related mammalian homologs, assumed to be non-damaging (Supplementary Methods). The second pair, HumVar3, consists of all the 13,032 human disease-causing mutations from UniProt, together with 8,946 human nsSNPs without annotated involvement in disease, which were treated as non-damaging.\r\n\r\nWe found that PolyPhen-2 performance, as presented by its receiver operating characteristic curves, was consistently superior compared to PolyPhen (Fig. 1b) and it also compared favorably with the three other popular prediction tools4\u20136 (Fig. 1c). For a false positive rate of 20%, PolyPhen-2 achieves the rate of true positive predictions of 92% and 73% on HumDiv and HumVar, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).\r\n\r\nOne reason for a lower accuracy of predictions on HumVar is that nsSNPs assumed to be non-damaging in HumVar contain a sizable fraction of mildly deleterious alleles. In contrast, most of amino acid replacements assumed non-damaging in HumDiv must be close to selective neutrality. Because alleles that are even mildly but unconditionally deleterious cannot be fixed in the evolving lineage, no method based on comparative sequence analysis is ideal for discriminating between drastically and mildly deleterious mutations, which are assigned to the opposite categories in HumVar. Another reason is that HumDiv uses an extra criterion to avoid possible erroneous annotations of damaging mutations.\r\n\r\nFor a mutation, PolyPhen-2 calculates Naive Bayes posterior probability that this mutation is damaging and reports estimates of false positive (the chance that the mutation is classified as damaging when it is in fact non-damaging) and true positive (the chance that the mutation is classified as damaging when it is indeed damaging) rates. A mutation is also appraised qualitatively, as benign, possibly damaging, or probably damaging (Supplementary Methods).\r\n\r\nThe user can choose between HumDiv- and HumVar-trained PolyPhen-2. Diagnostics of Mendelian diseases requires distinguishing mutations with drastic effects from all the remaining human variation, including abundant mildly deleterious alleles. Thus, HumVar-trained PolyPhen-2 should be used for this task. In contrast, HumDiv-trained PolyPhen-2 should be used for evaluating rare alleles at loci potentially involved in complex phenotypes, dense mapping of regions identified by genome-wide association studies, and analysis of natural selection from sequence data, where even mildly deleterious alleles must be treated as damaging.", "date": " 2010 ", "authors": ["Ivan A Adzhubei", "Steffen Schmidt", "Leonid Peshkin", "Vasily E Ramensky", "Anna Gerasimova", "Peer Bork", "Alexey S Kondrashov", "Shamil R Sunyaev"], "related_topics": ["multiple sequence alignment", "mutation (genetic algorithm)", "sequence analysis", "data interpretation, statistical *", "genetic variation"], "citation_count": "10,905", "reference_count": "6", "references": ["2143238378", "2109372707", "2123340910", "2099564671", "2128995100", "2156234555"]}, {"id": "2015416439", "title": "High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome.", "abstract": "Histone modifications are implicated in influencing gene expression.

Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe.

We developed and analysed global, regional, and subregional estimates of the causes of maternal death during 2003\u201309, with a novel method, updating the previous WHO systematic review.  Methods  We searched specialised and general bibliographic databases for articles published between between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2012, for research data, with no language restrictions, and the WHO mortality database for vital registration data. On the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, we analysed causes of maternal death from datasets. We aggregated country level estimates to report estimates of causes of death by Millennium Development Goal regions and worldwide, for main and subcauses of death categories with a Bayesian hierarchical model.  Findings  We identified 23 eligible studies (published 2003\u201312). We included 417 datasets from 115 countries comprising 60\u2008799 deaths in the analysis. About 73% (1\u2008771\u2008000 of 2\u2008443\u2008000) of all maternal deaths between 2003 and 2009 were due to direct obstetric causes and deaths due to indirect causes accounted for 27\u00b75% (672\u2008000, 95% UI 19\u00b77\u201337\u00b75) of all deaths. Haemorrhage accounted for 27\u00b71% (661\u2008000, 19\u00b79\u201336\u00b72), hypertensive disorders 14\u00b70% (343\u2008000, 11\u00b71\u201317\u00b74), and sepsis 10\u00b77% (261\u2008000, 5\u00b79\u201318\u00b76) of maternal deaths. The rest of deaths were due to abortion (7\u00b79% [193\u2008000], 4\u00b77\u201313\u00b72), embolism (3\u00b72% [78\u2008000], 1\u00b78\u20135\u00b75), and all other direct causes of death (9\u00b76% [235\u2008000], 6\u00b75\u201314\u00b73). Regional estimates varied substantially.  Interpretation  Between 2003 and 2009, haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and sepsis were responsible for more than half of maternal deaths worldwide.

In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase e (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2.

Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures.

The chromo domain of HP1 is necessary for both targeting and transcriptional repression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the correct localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) depends on Clr4, a homologue of the mammalian SUV39H1 histone methylase. Both Clr4 and SUV39H1 methylate specifically lysine 9 of histone H3 (ref. 6). Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4. The chromo domain of HP1 is identified as its methyl-lysine-binding domain. A point mutation in the chromo domain, which destroys the gene silencing activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolishes methyl-lysine-binding activity. Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe shows that the methylase activity of Clr4 is necessary for the correct localization of Swi6 at centromeric heterochromatin and for gene silencing. These results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a 'methyl marker' on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromo domain.

Methods  In our cross-sectional study, we included women attending health facilities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that dealt with at least 1000 childbirths per year and had the capacity to provide caesarean section. We obtained data from analysis of hospital records for all women giving birth and all women who had a severe maternal outcome (SMO; ie, maternal death or maternal near miss). We regarded coverage of key maternal health interventions as the proportion of the target population who received an indicated intervention (eg, the proportion of women with eclampsia who received magnesium sulphate). We used areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC) with 95% CI to externally validate a previously reported MSI as an indicator of severity. We assessed the overall performance of care (ie, the ability to produce a positive effect on health outcomes) through standardised mortality ratios.  Results  From May 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2011, we included 314\u2008623 women attending 357 health facilities in 29 countries (2538 had a maternal near miss and 486 maternal deaths occurred). The mean period of data collection in each health facility was 89 days (SD 21). 23\u2008015 (7\u00b73%) women had potentially life-threatening disorders and 3024 (1\u00b70%) developed an SMO. 808 (26\u00b77%) women with an SMO had post-partum haemorrhage and 784 (25\u00b79%) had pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and coagulation dysfunctions were the most frequent organ dysfunctions in women who had an SMO. Reported mortality in countries with a high or very high maternal mortality ratio was two-to-three-times higher than that expected for the assessed severity despite a high coverage of essential interventions. The MSI had good accuracy for maternal death prediction in women with markers of organ dysfunction (AUROC 0\u00b7826 [95% CI 0\u00b7802\u20130\u00b7851]).  Interpretation  High coverage of essential interventions did not imply reduced maternal mortality in the health-care facilities we studied. If substantial reductions in maternal mortality are to be achieved, universal coverage of life-saving interventions need to be matched with comprehensive emergency care and overall improvements in the quality of maternal health care. The MSI could be used to assess the performance of health facilities providing care to women with complications related to pregnancy.

This decline is predominantly due to the reduction in deaths from thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhage. For the first time there has been a reduction in the inequalities gap, with a significant decrease in maternal mortality rates among those living in the most deprived areas and those in the lowest socio-economic group. Despite a decline in the overall UK maternal mortality rate, there has been an increase in deaths related to genital tract sepsis, particularly from community acquired Group A streptococcal disease. The mortality rate related to sepsis increased from 0.85 deaths per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 1.13 deaths in 2006-2008, and sepsis is now the most common cause of Direct maternal death. Cardiac disease is the most common cause of Indirect death; the Indirect maternal mortality rate has not changed significantly since 2003-2005. This Confidential Enquiry identified substandard care in 70% of Direct deaths and 55% of Indirect deaths.

Reliable information about the rates and trends in maternal mortality is essential for resource mobilisation, and for planning and assessment of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 (MDG 5), the target for which is a 75% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) from 1990 to 2015. We assessed levels and trends in maternal mortality for 181 countries.  Methods  We constructed a database of 2651 observations of maternal mortality for 181 countries for 1980\u20132008, from vital registration data, censuses, surveys, and verbal autopsy studies. We used robust analytical methods to generate estimates of maternal deaths and the MMR for each year between 1980 and 2008. We explored the sensitivity of our data to model specification and show the out-of-sample predictive validity of our methods.  Findings  We estimated that there were 342\u2008900 (uncertainty interval 302\u2008100\u2013394\u2008300) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008, down from 526\u2008300 (446\u2008400\u2013629\u2008600) in 1980. The global MMR decreased from 422 (358\u2013505) in 1980 to 320 (272\u2013388) in 1990, and was 251 (221\u2013289) per 100\u2008000 livebirths in 2008. The yearly rate of decline of the global MMR since 1990 was 1\u00b73% (1\u00b70\u20131\u00b75). During 1990\u20132008, rates of yearly decline in the MMR varied between countries, from 8\u00b78% (8\u00b77\u201314\u00b71) in the Maldives to an increase of 5\u00b75% (5\u00b72\u20135\u00b76) in Zimbabwe. More than 50% of all maternal deaths were in only six countries in 2008 (India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In the absence of HIV, there would have been 281\u2008500 (243\u2008900\u2013327\u2008900) maternal deaths worldwide in 2008.  Interpretation  Substantial, albeit varied, progress has been made towards MDG 5.

We examined datasets reporting individual causes of death to investigate the heterogeneity due to methodological features and geographical region and the contribution of haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, abortion, and sepsis as causes of maternal death at the country level. Findings 34 datasets (35 197 maternal deaths) were included in the primary analysis. We recorded wide regional variation in the causes of maternal deaths. Haemorrhage was the leading cause of death in Africa (point estimate 33\u00b79%, range 13\u00b73-43\u00b76; eight datasets, 4508 deaths) and in Asia (30\u00b78%, 5\u00b79-48\u00b75; 11, 16 089).

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs).  Methods  Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis.  Findings  Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350\u2008000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient \u22120\u00b737). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa.  Interpretation  Rates of YLDs per 100\u2008000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.

However, other factors also affect the prognosis for these patients. Methods We prospectively studied a cohort of 4446 infants born at 22 to 25 weeks\u2019 gestation (determined on the basis of the best obstetrical estimate) in the Neonatal Research Network of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to relate risk factors assessable at or before birth to the likelihood of survival, survival without profound neurodevelopmental impairment, and survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at a corrected age of 18 to 22 months. Results Among study infants, 3702 (83%) received intensive care in the form of mechanical ventilation. Among the 4192 study infants (94%) for whom outcomes were determined at 18 to 22 months, 49% died, 61% died or had profound impairment, and 73% died or had impairment. In multivariable analyses of infants who received intensive care, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, female sex, singleton birth, and higher birth weight (per each 100-g increment) were each associated with reductions in the risk of death and the risk of death or profound or any neurodevelopmental impairment; these reductions were similar to those associated with a 1-week increase in gestational age. At the same estimated likelihood of a favorable outcome, girls were less likely than boys to receive intensive care. The outcomes for infants who underwent ventilation were better predicted with the use of the above factors than with use of gestational age alone. Conclusions The likelihood of a favorable outcome with intensive care can be better estimated by consideration of four factors in addition to gestational age: sex, exposure or nonexposure to antenatal corticosteroids, whether single or multiple birth, and birth weight.

It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability.

This prospective study attempted to improve the decision-making process by assessing outcomes for 4446 infants born at 22-25 weeks' gestation. Standardized neurodevelopmental assessments were made by specially trained examiners at a corrected age of 18-22 months. Both the Psychomotor Developmental Index and the Mental Developmental Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development were utilized. The 3702 infants given intensive care in the form of mechanical ventilation represented 83% of all those evaluated. Of 4192 study infants assessed at a corrected age of 18-22 months-constituting 94% of the study population-49% died, 61% died or had profound neurodevelopmental impairment, and 73% died or had some degree of impairment. Multivariable analysis of infants given intensive care identified 4 characteristics apart from gestational age, each of which was associated with a reduced risk of death, marked impairment, or any impairment. They included being female, being a singleton birth, higher birth weight, and antenatal exposure to corticosteroids. The reduction in risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment associated with each of these factors was comparable to that associated with a 1-week increase in gestational age. Outcomes for infants placed on ventilation were more accurately predicted when these additional factors were taken into account than when only gestational age was considered. Female infants in this study were less likely than males to receive intensive care. It was estimated that providing intensive care to all infants born at 22-23 weeks' gestation would have resulted in 0-9 additional survivors for every 100 infants treated.

We examined whether different amounts and types of physical activity are associated with lower mortality and CVD in countries at different economic levels.  Methods  In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 17 countries (Canada, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Colombia, Iran, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe). Within each country, urban and rural areas in and around selected cities and towns were identified to reflect the geographical diversity. Within these communities, we invited individuals aged between 35 and 70 years who intended to live at their current address for at least another 4 years. Total physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPQA). Participants with pre-existing CVD were excluded from the analyses. Mortality and CVD were recorded during a mean of 6\u00b79 years of follow-up. Primary clinical outcomes during follow-up were mortality plus major CVD (CVD mortality, incident myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure), either as a composite or separately. The effects of physical activity on mortality and CVD were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and other risk factors taking into account household, community, and country clustering.  Findings  Between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2010, 168\u2008916 participants were enrolled, of whom 141\u2008945 completed the IPAQ. Analyses were limited to the 130\u2008843 participants without pre-existing CVD. Compared with low physical activity ( 3000 MET\u2008\u00d7\u2008minutes or >750 minutes per week) were associated with graded reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0\u00b780, 95% CI 0\u00b774\u20130\u00b787 and 0\u00b765, 0\u00b760\u20130\u00b771; p  Interpretation  Higher recreational and non-recreational physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality and CVD events in individuals from low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. Increasing physical activity is a simple, widely applicable, low cost global strategy that could reduce deaths and CVD in middle age.

Design Nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting Forty-two tertiary hospitals. Population Women admitted for pregnancy childbirth and puerperal complications. Methods All cases of severe maternal outcome (SMO: maternal near-miss or maternal death) were prospectively identified using the WHO criteria over a 1-year period. Main outcome measures Incidence and causes of SMO health service events case fatality rate and mortality index (% of maternal death/SMO). Results Participating hospitals recorded 91 724 live births and 5910 stillbirths. A total of 2449 women had an SMO including 1451 near-misses and 998 maternal deaths (2.7 1.6 and 1.1% of live births respectively). The majority (91.8%) of SMO cases were admitted in critical condition. Leading causes of SMO were pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (23.4%) and postpartum hemorrhage (14.4%). The overall mortality index for life-threatening conditions was 40.8%. For all SMOs the median time between diagnosis and critical intervention was 60 minutes (IQR: 21-215 minutes) but in 21.9% of cases it was over 4 hours. Late presentation (35.3%) lack of health insurance (17.5%) and non-availability of blood/blood products (12.7%) were the most frequent problems associated with deficiencies in care. Conclusions Improving the chances of maternal survival would not only require timely application of life-saving interventions but also their safe efficient and equitable use.

With universal coverage of midwifery interventions for maternal and newborn health, excluding family planning, for the countries with the lowest HDI, 61% of all maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths could be prevented. Family planning alone could prevent 57% of all deaths because of reduced fertility and fewer pregnancies. Midwifery with both family planning and interventions for maternal and newborn health could avert a total of 83% of all maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths.

Because much of the world's population is inactive, this link presents a major public health issue. We aimed to quantify the effect of physical inactivity on these major non-communicable diseases by estimating how much disease could be averted if inactive people were to become active and to estimate gain in life expectancy at the population level.

We used life-table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.  Findings  Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6% (ranging from 3\u00b72% in southeast Asia to 7\u00b78% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% (3\u00b79\u20139\u00b76) of type 2 diabetes, 10% (5\u00b76\u201314\u00b71) of breast cancer, and 10% (5\u00b77\u201313\u00b78) of colon cancer.

Inactivity causes 9% (range 5\u00b71\u201312\u00b75) of premature mortality, or more than 5\u00b73 million of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, but decreased instead by 10% or 25%, more than 533\u2008000 and more than 1\u00b73 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the world's population by 0\u00b768 (range 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b795) years.  Interpretation  Physical inactivity has a major health effect worldwide. Decrease in or removal of this unhealthy behaviour could improve health substantially.

In this report, we describe physical activity levels worldwide with data for adults (15 years or older) from 122 countries and for adolescents (13\u201315-years-old) from 105 countries. Worldwide, 31\u00b71% (95% CI 30\u00b79\u201331\u00b72) of adults are physically inactive, with proportions ranging from 17\u00b70% (16\u00b78\u201317\u00b72) in southeast Asia to about 43% in the Americas and the eastern Mediterranean. Inactivity rises with age, is higher in women than in men, and is increased in high-income countries. The proportion of 13\u201315-year-olds doing fewer than 60 min of physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity per day is 80\u00b73% (80\u00b71\u201380\u00b75); boys are more active than are girls. Continued improvement in monitoring of physical activity would help to guide development of policies and programmes to increase activity levels and to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases.", "date": " 2012 ", "authors": ["Pedro C.

Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. All risks combined account for 57\u00b72% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55\u00b78-58\u00b75) of deaths and 41\u00b76% (40\u00b71-43\u00b70) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87\u00b79% (86\u00b75-89\u00b73) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11\u00b73 million deaths and 241\u00b74 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10\u00b74 million deaths and 208\u00b71 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1\u00b77 million deaths and 176\u00b79 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6\u00b71 million deaths and 143\u00b75 million DALYs, air pollution for 5\u00b75 million deaths and 141\u00b75 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4\u00b74 million deaths and 134\u00b70 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.

The proposed method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to reconstruct the Markov jump processes underlying the phase-type variables in combination with Gibbs sampling to obtain a stationary sequence of phase-type probability measures from the posterior distribution of these given the observations. This enables us to find quantiles of posterior distributions of functionals of interest, thereby representing estimation uncertainty in a flexible way.

In many cases, the staging is defined on the basis of a discretization of the values of continuous markers (CD4 cell count for HIV application) that are subject to great variability due mainly to short time-scale noise (intraindividual variability) and measurement errors. This led us to formulate a Bayesian hierarchical model where, at a first level, a disease process (Markov model on the true states, which are unobserved) is introduced and, at a second level, the measurement process making the link between the true states and the observed marker values is modeled. This hierarchical formulation allows joint estimation of the parameters of both processes.

Valid, reliable, and comparable assessments of trends in causes of death from even the best systems are limited by three problems: a) changes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) over time; b) the use of tabulation lists where substantial detail on causes of death is lost; and c) many deaths assigned to causes that cannot or should not be considered underlying causes of death, often called garbage codes (GCs). The Global Burden of Disease Study and the World Health Organization have developed various methods to enhance comparability of CoD data. In this study, we attempt to build on these approaches to enhance the utility of national cause-of-death data for public health analysis. Based on careful consideration of 4,434 country-years of CoD data from 145 countries from 1901 to 2008, encompassing 743 million deaths in ICD versions 1 to 10 as well as country-specific cause lists, we have developed a public health-oriented cause-of-death list. These 56 causes are organized hierarchically and encompass all deaths. Each cause has been mapped from ICD-6 to ICD-10 and, where possible, they have also been mapped to the International List of Causes of Death 1-5. We developed a typology of different classes of GCs. In each ICD revision, GCs have been identified. Target causes to which these GCs should be redistributed have been identified based on certification practice and/or pathophysiology. Proportionate redistribution, statistical models, and expert algorithms have been developed to redistribute GCs to target codes for each age-sex group. The fraction of all deaths assigned to GCs varies tremendously across countries and revisions of the ICD. In general, across all country-years of data available, GCs have declined from more than 43% in ICD-7 to 24% in ICD-10. In some regions, such as Australasia, GCs in 2005 are as low as 11%, while in some developing countries, such as Thailand, they are greater than 50%. Across different age groups, the composition of GCs varies tremendously - three classes of GCs steadily increase with age, but ambiguous codes within a particular disease chapter are also common for injuries at younger ages. The impact of redistribution is to change the number of deaths assigned to particular causes for a given age-sex group. These changes alter ranks across countries for any given year by a number of different causes, change time trends, and alter the rank order of causes within a country. By mapping CoD through different ICD versions and redistributing GCs, we believe the public health utility of CoD data can be substantially enhanced, leading to an increased demand for higher quality CoD data from health sector decision-makers.", "date": " 2010 ", "authors": ["Mohsen Naghavi", "Susanna Makela", "Kyle Foreman", "Janaki O'Brien", "Farshad Pourmalek", "Rafael Lozano"], "related_topics": ["international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems", "developing country", "public health"], "citation_count": "242", "reference_count": "35", "references": ["1583327662", "1971816555", "3125791771", "2108361166", "2130275438", "1560478899", "2066141375", "2149316927", "2106726453", "2142266325", "2071479198"]}, {"id": "2083244949", "title": "Estimates of Maternal Mortality Worldwide Between 1990 and 2005: An Assessment of Available Data", "abstract": "Summary  Background  Maternal mortality, as a largely avoidable cause of death, is an important focus of international development efforts, and a target for Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5.

We aimed to report on 68 countries which have 97% of maternal and child deaths worldwide, and on 22 interventions that have been proven to improve maternal, newborn, and child survival. \n\nMETHODS We selected countries with high rates of maternal and child deaths, and interventions with the most potential to avert such deaths. We analysed country-specific data for maternal and child mortality and coverage of selected interventions. We also tracked cause-of-death profiles; indicators of nutritional status; the presence of supportive policies; financial flows to maternal, newborn, and child health; and equity in coverage of interventions. \n\nFINDINGS Of the 68 priority countries, 16 were on track to meet MDG 4. Of these, seven had been on track in 2005 when the Countdown initiative was launched, three (including China) moved into the on-track category in 2008, and six were included in the Countdown process for the first time in 2008. Trends in maternal mortality that would indicate progress towards MDG 5 were not available, but in most (56 of 68) countries, maternal mortality was high or very high. Coverage of different interventions varied widely both between and within countries. Interventions that can be routinely scheduled, such as immunisation and antenatal care, had much higher coverage than those that rely on functional health systems and 24-hour availability of clinical services, such as skilled or emergency care at birth and care of ill newborn babies and children. Data for postnatal care were either unavailable or showed poor coverage in almost all 68 countries. The most rapid increases in coverage were seen for immunisation, which also received significant investment during this period. \n\nINTERPRETATION Rapid progress is possible, but much more can and must be done.

Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes.  There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes.  Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.", "date": " 2014 ", "authors": ["Paul A.

Methods Information was obtained on each of one million adults with no previous vascular disease recorded at baseline in 61 prospective observational studies of blood pressure and mortality. During 12.7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56 000 vascular deaths (12 000 stroke, 34000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 10000 other vascular) and 66 000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years. Meta-analyses, involving \"time-dependent\" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade. Findings Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP), below which there is little evidence. At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual SBP (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual DBP) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from IHD and from other vascular causes. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at,ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age. The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia. For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of SBP and DBP is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative.

Objective  To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.  Design  Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998.  Interventions  Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).  Main outcomes measures  The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.  Results  On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.  Conclusions  Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial.

Findings In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7\u00b70% [95% uncertainty interval 6\u00b72\u20137\u00b77] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6\u00b73% [5\u00b75\u20137\u00b70]), and alcohol use (5\u00b75% [5\u00b70\u20135\u00b79]).

For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015.  Methods  We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60\u2008900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores.  Findings  We generated 9\u00b73 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17\u00b72 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15\u00b74\u201319\u00b72 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2\u00b739 billion, 2\u00b730\u20132\u00b750 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2\u00b736 billion (2\u00b735\u20132\u00b737 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20\u201330% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Interpretation  Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures.  Methods  We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14\u2008294 geography\u2013year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).  Findings  Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61\u00b77 years (95% uncertainty interval 61\u00b74\u201361\u00b79) in 1980 to 71\u00b78 years (71\u00b75\u201372\u00b72) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11\u00b73 years (3\u00b77\u201317\u00b74), to 62\u00b76 years (56\u00b75\u201370\u00b72). Total deaths increased by 4\u00b71% (2\u00b76\u20135\u00b76) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55\u00b78 million (54\u00b79 million to 56\u00b76 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17\u00b70% (15\u00b78\u201318\u00b71) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14\u00b71% (12\u00b76\u201316\u00b70) to 39\u00b78 million (39\u00b72 million to 40\u00b75 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13\u00b71% (11\u00b79\u201314\u00b73). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42\u00b71%, 39\u00b71\u201344\u00b76), malaria (43\u00b71%, 34\u00b77\u201351\u00b78), neonatal preterm birth complications (29\u00b78%, 24\u00b78\u201334\u00b79), and maternal disorders (29\u00b71%, 19\u00b73\u201337\u00b71). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146\u2008000 deaths, 118\u2008000\u2013183\u2008000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393\u2008000 deaths, 228\u2008000\u2013532\u2008000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death.  Interpretation  At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

It represents the culmination of a series of interagency and interregional discussions which helped to generate increased understanding around the challenges of measuring maternal mortality monitoring trends and interpreting results derived from different measurement strategies and information sources. The document begins by summarizing the complexity involved in measuring maternal mortality and the reasons why such measurement is subject to uncertainty.  Subsequently the rationale for the development of 1995 estimates of maternal mortality is presented along with a description of the process through which this was accomplished.  An analysis and interpretation of the results follows which compares them to the 1990 estimates developed by WHO and UN Childrens Fund and describes some of the difficulties that such comparisons involve.  This section points out the disadvantages of using the estimates to draw conclusions about trends.

We evaluated use of the national population census as a means of measuring maternal mortality by assessing data from five countries (Benin, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe) which identified maternal deaths in their censuses. Standard demographic methods were used to evaluate the completeness of reporting of adult female deaths and births in the year prior to the census. The results from these exercises were used to adjust the data. In four countries, the numbers of adult female deaths needed to be increased and three countries required upward adjustment of the numbers of recent births. The number of maternal deaths was increased by the same factor as that used for adult female deaths on the assumption that the proportion of adult female deaths due to maternal causes was correct. Age patterns of the various maternal mortality indicators were plausible and consistent with external sources of data for other populations. Our data suggest that under favourable conditions a national census is a feasible and promising approach for the measurement of maternal mortality. Moreover, use of the census circumvents several of the weaknesses of methods currently in use. However, it should also be noted that careful evaluation of the data and adjustment, if necessary, are essential.

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation. Primary Recommendation\u2014To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

International Physical Activity Questionnaire: 12-Country Reliability and Validity. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 35, No. 8, pp. 1381-1395, 2003. Background: Physical inactivity is a global concern, but diverse physical activity measures in use prevent international comparisons. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity. Methods: Between 1997 and 1998, an International Consensus Group developed four long and four short forms of the IPAQ instruments (administered by telephone interview or self-administration, with two alternate reference periods, either the \"last 7 d\" or a \"usual week\" of recalled physical activity). During 2000, 14 centers from 12 countries collected reliability and/or validity data on at least two of the eight IPAQ instruments. Test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week. Concurrent (inter-method) validity was assessed at the same administration, and criterion IPAQ validity was assessed against the CSA (now MTI) accelerometer. Spearman's correlation coefficients are reported, based on the total reported physical activity. Results: Overall, the IPAQ questionnaires produced repeatable data (Spearman's clustered around 0.8), with comparable data from short and long forms. Criterion validity had a median of about 0.30, which was comparable to most other self-report validation studies. The \"usual week\" and \"last 7 d\" reference periods performed similarly, and the reliability of telephone administration was similar to the self-administered mode. Conclusions: The IPAQ instruments have acceptable measurement properties, at least as good as other established self-reports.

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.\n\nPrimary Recommendation: To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

Our aim was to estimate global and regional mortality in 2000 caused by smoking, including an analysis of uncertainty. Methods Following the methods of Peto and colleagues, we used lung-cancer mortality as an indirect marker for accumulated smoking risk. Never-smoker lung-cancer mortality was estimated based on the household use of coal with poor ventilation. Relative risks were taken from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study, phase II, and the retrospective proportional mortality analysis of Liu and colleagues in China. Relative risks were corrected for confounding and extrapolation to other regions. Results We estimated that in 2000, 4.83 (uncertainty range 3.94-5.93) million premature deaths in the world were attributable to smoking; 2.41 (1.80-3.15) million in developing countries and 2.43 (2.13-2.78) million in industrialised countries. 3.84 million of these deaths were in men. The leading causes of death from smoking were cardiovascular diseases (1.69 million deaths), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.97 million deaths), and lung cancer (0.85 million deaths). Interpretation Smoking was an important cause of global mortality in 2000.

We assessed the health benefits of a range of volumes of physical activity in a Taiwanese population.  Methods  In this prospective cohort study, 416\u2008175 individuals (199\u2008265 men and 216\u2008910 women) participated in a standard medical screening programme in Taiwan between 1996 and 2008, with an average follow-up of 8\u00b705 years (SD 4\u00b721). On the basis of the amount of weekly exercise indicated in a self-administered questionnaire, participants were placed into one of five categories of exercise volumes: inactive, or low, medium, high, or very high activity. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) for mortality risks for every group compared with the inactive group, and calculated life expectancy for every group.  Findings  Compared with individuals in the inactive group, those in the low-volume activity group, who exercised for an average of 92 min per week (95% CI 71\u2013112) or 15 min a day (SD 1\u00b78), had a 14% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (0\u00b786, 0\u00b781\u20130\u00b791), and had a 3 year longer life expectancy. Every additional 15 min of daily exercise beyond the minimum amount of 15 min a day further reduced all-cause mortality by 4% (95% CI 2\u00b75\u20137\u00b70) and all-cancer mortality by 1% (0\u00b73\u20134\u00b75).

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2\u00b787 for current vs never, PAR 35\u00b77% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3\u00b725 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49\u00b72% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1\u00b791, PAR 17\u00b79%), diabetes (2\u00b737, PAR 9\u00b79%), abdominal obesity (1\u00b712 for top vs lowest tertile and 1\u00b762 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20\u00b71% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2\u00b767, PAR 32\u00b75%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0\u00b770, PAR 13\u00b77% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0\u00b791, PAR 6\u00b77%), and regular physical activity (0\u00b786, PAR 12\u00b72%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0\u00b70001 for all risk factors and p=0\u00b703 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women.

Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy\u2014 value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations.

Today the World Health Organization (WHO) finds itself needing to deal with the new pandemic of obesity and its accompanying non-communicable diseases (NCDs) while the challenge of childhood malnutrition has far from disappeared, TB and malaria rates are escalating, and the scourge of AIDS has emerged. This has created a 'double burden' of disease that threatens to overwhelm the health services of many resource-poor countries. WHO warns that the greater future burden of obesity and diabetes will affect developing countries, and the projected numbers of new cases of diabetes run into the hundreds of millions within the next 2 decades. The obesity pandemic originated in the US and crossed to Europe and the world's other rich nations before, remarkably, it penetrated even the world's poorest countries especially in their urban areas. The pandemic is transmitted through the vectors of subsidized agriculture and multinational companies providing cheap, highly refined fats, oils, and carbohydrates, labour-saving mechanized devices, affordable motorized transport, and the seductions of sedentary pastimes such as television. This paper briefly reviews these macro-environmental trends as well as considering some of the socio-behavioural influences on weight gain in traditional societies.

A phone survey was carried out in 2011 with professionals working in primary health care in Brazil. The target sample consisted of 1,600 randomly selected primary care units covering all regions of the country. We successfully interviewed 529 professionals within the sampled units; 182 physicians and 347 nurses. The overall response rate was 49.6%. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate correlates of counseling in the whole sample and separately for physicians and nurses. The prevalence of regular physical activity counseling for at least six months was 68.9% (95% CI 64.9; 72.8) and was significantly higher among physicians compared to nurses (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Physicians and nurses deemed physical activity counseling of great importance in primary health care in Brazil. However, in order to increase the quality of counseling and the number of professionals engaging in this activity, these health teams require greater knowledge about physical activity (global recommendations for health) as well as training on the application of instruments for assessing physical activity.

Social desirability was associated with overreporting of activity, resulting in overestimation of physical activity energy expenditure by 0.65 kcal/kg/day on the second 7-day PAR (95% confidence interval: 0.06, 1.25) and overestimation of activity durations by 4.15-11.30 minutes/day (both 7-day PARs).

An intermediate analysis showed a striking protective effect after 27 months of follow-up. This report presents results of an extended follow-up (with a mean of 46 months per patient) and deals with the relationships of dietary patterns and traditional risk factors with recurrence. METHODS AND RESULTS--Three composite outcomes (COs) combining either cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (CO 1), or the preceding plus major secondary end points (unstable angina, stroke, heart failure, pulmonary or peripheral embolism) (CO 2), or the preceding plus minor events requiring hospital admission (CO 3) were studied. In the Mediterranean diet group, CO 1 was reduced (14 events versus 44 in the prudent Western-type diet group, P=0.0001), as were CO 2 (27 events versus 90, P=0.0001) and CO 3 (95 events versus 180, P=0. 0002). Adjusted risk ratios ranged from 0.28 to 0.53. Among the traditional risk factors, total cholesterol (1 mmol/L being associated with an increased risk of 18% to 28%), systolic blood pressure (1 mm Hg being associated with an increased risk of 1% to 2%), leukocyte count (adjusted risk ratios ranging from 1.64 to 2.86 with count >9x10(9)/L), female sex (adjusted risk ratios, 0.27 to 0. 46), and aspirin use (adjusted risk ratios, 0.59 to 0.82) were each significantly and independently associated with recurrence. CONCLUSIONS--The protective effect of the Mediterranean dietary pattern was maintained up to 4 years after the first infarction, confirming previous intermediate analyses. Major traditional risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and blood pressure, were shown to be independent and joint predictors of recurrence, indicating that the Mediterranean dietary pattern did not alter, at least qualitatively, the usual relationships between major risk factors and recurrence. Thus, a comprehensive strategy to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality should include primarily a cardioprotective diet. It should be associated with other (pharmacological?) means aimed at reducing modifiable risk factors.

However, previous studies have been in mainly North American or European populations. The aim of the present analysis was to investigate the relation of psychosocial factors to risk of myocardial infarction in 24767 people from 52 countries.  Methods  We used a case-control design with 11119 patients with a first myocardial infarction and 13648 age-matched (up to 5 years older or younger) and sex-matched controls from 262 centres in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and North and South America. Data for demographic factors, education, income, and cardiovascular risk factors were obtained by standardised approaches. Psychosocial stress was assessed by four simple questions about stress at work and at home, financial stress, and major life events in the past year. Additional questions assessed locus of control and presence of depression.  Findings  People with myocardial infarction (cases) reported higher prevalence of all four stress factors (p vs  12\u00b72% [1659]; odds ratio 1\u00b733 [99% CI 1\u00b719\u20131\u00b748]). Stressful life events in the past year were also more frequent in cases than controls (16\u00b71% [1790] vs 13\u00b70% [1771]; 1\u00b748 [1\u00b733\u20131\u00b764]), as was depression (24\u00b70% [2673]  vs  17\u00b76% [2404]; odds ratio 1\u00b755 [1\u00b742\u20131\u00b769]). These differences were consistent across regions, in different ethnic groups, and in men and women.  Interpretation  Presence of psychosocial stressors is associated with increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, suggesting that approaches aimed at modifying these factors should be developed.

Design Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to 2001. Setting United Kingdom. Participants 34 439 male British doctors. Information about their smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and periodically thereafter; cause specific mortality was monitored for 50 years. Main outcome measures Overall mortality by smoking habit, considering separately men born in different periods. Results The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly involved vascular, neoplastic, and respiratory diseases that can be caused by smoking. Men born in 1900-1930 who smoked only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about 10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers. Cessation at age 60, 50, 40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years of life expectancy. The excess mortality associated with cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19th century and was greatest for men born in the 1920s. The cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of dying in middle age (35-69) were 42% v 24% (a twofold death rate ratio) for those born in 1900-1909, but were 43% v 15% (a threefold death rate ratio) for those born in the 1920s. At older ages, the cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of surviving from age 70 to 90 were 10% v 12% at the death rates of the 1950s (that is, among men born around the 1870s) but were 7% v 33% (again a threefold death rate ratio) at the death rates of the 1990s (that is, among men born around the 1910s). Conclusion A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality rates among non-smokers over the past half century (due to prevention and improved treatment of disease) has been wholly outweighed, among cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase in the smoker v non-smoker death rate ratio due to earlier and more intensive use of cigarettes. Among the men born around 1920, prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled age specific mortality rates, but cessation at age 50 halved the hazard, and cessation at age 30 avoided almost all of it.", "date": " 2004 ", "authors": ["Richard Doll", "Richard Peto", "Jillian Boreham", "Isabelle Sutherland"], "related_topics": ["cigarette smoker", "mortality rate", "middle age", "life expectancy", "prospective cohort study", "demography", "disease", "medicine", "cigarette smoking", "excess mortality"], "citation_count": "6,014", "reference_count": "33", "references": []}, {"id": "2952432278", "title": "Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Part I: General Considerations, the Epidemiologic Transition, Risk Factors, and Impact of Urbanization", "abstract": "This two-part article provides an overview of the global burden of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease.

Previous evidence about the effects of lowering cholesterol in people with diabetes has been limited, and most diabetic patients do not currently receive cholesterol-lowering therapy despite their increased risk. METHODS 5963 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) known to have diabetes, and an additional 14573 with occlusive arterial disease (but no diagnosed diabetes), were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified analyses in these prior disease subcategories, and other relevant subcategories, were of first major coronary event (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death) and of first major vascular event (ie, major coronary event, stroke or revascularisation). Analyses were also conducted of subsequent vascular events during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, intention to treat), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. FINDINGS Both among the participants who presented with diabetes and among those who did not, there were highly significant reductions of about a quarter in the first event rate for major coronary events, for strokes, and for revascularisations. For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a definite 22% (95% CI 13-30) reduction in the event rate (601 [20.2%] simvastatin-allocated vs 748 [25.1%] placebo-allocated, p<0.0001), which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. There were also highly significant reductions of 33% (95% CI 17-46, p=0.0003) among the 2912 diabetic participants who did not have any diagnosed occlusive arterial disease at entry, and of 27% (95% CI 13-40, p=0.0007) among the 2426 diabetic participants whose pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentration was below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL). The proportional reduction in risk was also about a quarter among various other subcategories of diabetic patient studied, including: those with different duration, type, or control of diabetes; those aged over 65 years at entry or with hypertension; and those with total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). In addition, among participants who had a first major vascular event following randomisation, allocation to simvastatin reduced the rate of subsequent events during the scheduled treatment period. INTERPRETATION The present study provides direct evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease or high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in a wide range of diabetic patients studied. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this statin regimen would probably reduce these rates by about a third. For example, among the type of diabetic patient studied without occlusive arterial disease, 5 years of treatment would be expected to prevent about 45 people per 1000 from having at least one major vascular event (and, among these 45 people, to prevent about 70 first or subsequent events during this treatment period). Statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.", "date": " 2003 ", "authors": ["Rory Collins", "Jane Armitage", "Sarah Parish", "Peter Sleigh", "Richard Peto"], "related_topics": ["statin", "diabetes mellitus", "myocardial infarction", "adult", "aged"], "citation_count": "3,999", "reference_count": "45", "references": []}, {"id": "2100346673", "title": "Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors", "abstract": "In 1951 the British Medical Association forwarded to all British doctors a questionnaire about their smoking habits, and 34440 men replied. With few exceptions, all men who replied in 1951 have been followed for 20 years. The certified causes of all 10 072 deaths and subsequent changes in smoking habits were recorded. The ratio of the death rate among cigarette smokers to that among lifelong non-smokers of comparable age was, for men under 70 years, about 2:1, while for men over 70 years it was about 1-5:1. These ratios suggest that between a half and a third of all cigarette smokers will die because of their smoking, if the excess death rates are actually caused by smoking. To investigate whether this is the case, the relation of many different causes of death to age and tobacco consumption were examined, as were the effects of giving up smoking. Smoking caused death chiefly by heart disease among middle-aged men (and, with a less extreme relative risk, among old men,) lung cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease, and various vascular diseases. The distinctive features of this study were the completeness of follow-up, the accuracy of death certification, and the fact that the study population as a whole reduced its cigarette consumption substantially during the period of observation.

But, because of the diluting effects of random fluctuations in DBP, these substantially underestimate the true associations of the usual DBP (ie, an individual's long-term average DBP) with disease. After correction for this \"regression dilution\" bias, prolonged differences in usual DBP of 5, 7.5, and 10 mm Hg were respectively associated with at least 34%, 46%, and 56% less stroke and at least 21%, 29%, and 37% less CHD. These associations are about 60% greater than in previous uncorrected analyses. (This regression dilution bias is quite general, so analogous corrections to the relations of cholesterol to CHD or of various other risk factors to CHD or to other diseases would likewise increase their estimated strengths.) The DBP results suggest that for the large majority of individuals, whether conventionally \"hypertensive\" or \"normotensive\", a lower blood pressure should eventually confer a lower risk of vascular disease.", "date": " 1990 ", "authors": ["S Macmahon", "R Peto", "J E Cutler", "R Collins", "P D Sorlie", "J Neaton", "R Abbott", "J Godwin", "A Dyer", "J Stamler"], "related_topics": ["regression dilution", "blood pressure", "stroke"], "citation_count": "5,670", "reference_count": "34", "references": ["2139480984", "1481480932", "1971681111", "2089098721", "572610557", "2087425451", "2147004612", "2333081132", "2088492277", "2089074745"]}, {"id": "2015918699", "title": "The Disease Burden Associated with Overweight and Obesity", "abstract": "ContextOverweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States\nand most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions.ObjectiveTo describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of\nhealth conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population.Design and SettingNationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which\nwas conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994.ParticipantsA total of 16,884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight\nand obese (body mass index [BMI] \u226525 kg/m2) based on National\nInstitutes of Health recommended guidelines.Main Outcome MeasuresPrevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, coronary\nheart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis.ResultsSixty-three percent of men and 55% of women had a body mass index of\n25 kg/m2 or greater.

We aimed to estimate effects of strategies based on different drug classes (angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs], and diuretics or beta blockers) or those targeting different blood pressure goals, on the risks of major cardiovascular events and death. METHODS We did seven sets of prospectively-designed overviews with data from 29 randomised trials (n=162341). The trial eligibility criteria, primary outcomes, and main hypotheses were specified before the result of any contributing trial was known. FINDINGS In placebo-controlled trials the relative risks of total major cardiovascular events were reduced by regimens based on ACE inhibitors (22%; 95% CI 17-27) or calcium antagonists (18%; 5-29). Greater risk reductions were produced by regimens that targeted lower blood pressure goals (15%; 5-24). ARB-based regimens reduced the risks of total major cardiovascular events (10%; 4-17) compared with control regimens. There were no significant differences in total major cardiovascular events between regimens based on ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics or beta blockers, although ACE-inhibitor-based regimens reduced blood pressure less. There was evidence of some differences between active regimens in their effects on cause-specific outcomes. For every outcome other than heart failure, the difference between randomised groups in achieved blood pressure reduction was directly related to the observed difference in risk.

The strategy was to simultaneously reduce four cardiovascular risk factors (low density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, serum homocysteine, and platelet function) regardless of pretreatment levels.   Design  We quantified the efficacy and adverse effects of the proposed formulation from published meta-analyses of randomised trials and cohort studies and a meta-analysis of 15 trials of low dose (50-125 mg/day) aspirin.   Outcome measures  Proportional reduction in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) events and strokes; life years gained; and prevalence of adverse effects.   Results  The formulation which met our objectives was: a statin (for example, atorvastatin (daily dose 10 mg) or simvastatin (40 mg)); three blood pressure lowering drugs (for example, a thiazide, a \u03b2 blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), each at half standard dose; folic acid (0.8 mg); and aspirin (75 mg). We estimate that the combination (which we call the Polypill) reduces IHD events by 88% (95% confidence interval 84% to 91%) and stroke by 80% (71% to 87%). One third of people taking this pill from age 55 would benefit, gaining on average about 11 years of life free from an IHD event or stroke. Summing the adverse effects of the components observed in randomised trials shows that the Polypill would cause symptoms in 8-15% of people (depending on the precise formulation).   Conclusion  The Polypill strategy could largely prevent heart attacks and stroke if taken by everyone aged 55 and older and everyone with existing cardiovascular disease.

We assessed prevalence and mortality risks for all stages of chronic kidney disease and quantified its attributable mortality in Taiwan.  Methods  The cohort consisted of 462\u2008293 individuals aged older than 20 years who participated in a standard medical screening programme since 1994. As of Dec 31, 2006, we identified 14\u2008436 deaths. Chronic kidney disease was determined by glomerular filtration rate and urinary protein. We estimated national prevalence in Taiwan from the cohort by adjusting age and educational levels. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with Cox proportionate hazards model. We calculated mortality attributable to chronic kidney disease for national population and for low socioeconomic status.  Findings  The national prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11\u00b793% (95% CI 11\u00b766\u201312\u00b728), but only 3\u00b754% (3\u00b737\u20133\u00b768) of participants in the cohort were aware of their disorder.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem. In the United States, there is a rising incidence and prevalence of kidney failure, with poor outcomes and high cost. There is an even higher prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. Increasing evidence, accrued in the past decades, indicates that the adverse outcomes of chronic kidney disease, such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death, can be prevented or delayed. Earlier stages of chronic kidney disease can be detected through laboratory testing. Treatment of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease is effective in slowing the progression toward kidney failure. Initiation of treatment for cardiovascular risk factors at earlier stages of chronic kidney disease should be effective in reducing cardiovascular disease events both before and after the onset of kidney failure. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is \"under-diagnosed\" and \"under-treated\" in the United States, resulting in lost opportunities for prevention. One reason is the lack of agreement on a definition and classification of stages in the progression of chronic kidney disease. A clinically applicable classification would be based on laboratory evaluation of the severity of kidney disease, association of level of kidney function with complications, and stratification of risks for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. Charge to the K/DOQI work group on chronic kidney disease. In 2000, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Advisory Board approved development of clinical practice guidelines to define chronic kidney disease and to classify stages in the progression of chronic kidney disease. The Work Group charged with developing the guidelines consisted of experts in nephrology, pediatric nephrology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, nutrition, social work, gerontology, and family medicine. An Evidence Review Team, consisting of nephrologists and methodologists, was responsible for assembling the evidence. Defining chronic kidney disease and classifying the stages of severity would provide a common language for communication among providers, patients and their families, investigators, and policy-makers and a framework for developing a public health approach to affect care and improve outcomes of chronic kidney disease. A uniform terminology would permit: 1. More reliable estimates of the prevalence of earlier stages of disease and of the population at increased risk for development of chronic kidney disease 2. Recommendations for laboratory testing to detect earlier stages and progression to later stages 3. Associations of stages with clinical manifestations of disease 4. Evaluation of factors associated with a high risk of progression from one stage to the next or of development of other adverse outcomes 5. Evaluation of treatments to slow progression or prevent other adverse outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines, clinical performance measures, and continuous quality improvement efforts could then be directed to stages of chronic kidney disease. The Work Group did not specifically address evaluation and treatment for chronic kidney disease. However, this guideline contains brief reference to diagnosis and clinical interventions and can serve as a \"road map\" linking other clinical practice guidelines and pointing out where other guidelines need to be developed. Eventually, K/DOQI will include interventional guidelines. The first three of these, on bone disease, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure management are currently under development. Other guidelines on cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients and kidney biopsy will be initiated in the Winter of 2001. This report contains a summary of background information available at the time the Work Group began its deliberations, the 15 guidelines and the accompanying rationale, suggestions for clinical performance measures, a clinical approach to chronic kidney disease using these guidelines, and appendices to describe methods for the review of evidence. The guidelines are based on a systematic review of the literature and the consensus of the Work Group. The guidelines have been reviewed by the K/DOQI Advisory Board, a large number of professional organizations and societies, selected experts, and interested members of the public and have been approved by the Board of Directors of the NKF. Framework. The Work Group defined \"chronic kidney disease\" to include conditions that affect the kidney, with the potential to cause either progressive loss of kidney function or complications resulting from decreased kidney function. Chronic kidney disease was thus defined as the presence of kidney damage or decreased level of kidney function for three months or more, irrespective of diagnosis. The target population includes individuals with chronic kidney disease or at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. The majority of topics focus on adults (age \u226518 years). Many of the same principles apply to children as well. In particular, the classification of stages of disease and principles of diagnostic testing are similar. A subcommittee of the Work Group examined issues related to children and participated in development of the first six guidelines of the present document. However, there are sufficient differences between adults and children in the association of GFR with signs and symptoms of uremia and in stratification of risk for adverse outcomes that these latter issues are addressed only for adults. A separate set of guidelines for children will have to be developed by a later Work Group. The target audience includes a wide range of individuals: those who have or are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (the target population) and their families; health care professionals caring for the target population; manufacturers of instruments and diagnostic laboratories performing measurements of kidney function; agencies and institutions planning, providing or paying for the health care needs of the target population; and investigators studying chronic kidney disease. There will be only brief reference to clinical interventions, sufficient to provide a basis for other clinical practice guidelines relevant to the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. Subsequent K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines will be based on the framework developed here. Definition of chronic kidney disease. Why \"Kidney\"? The word \"kidney\" is of Middle English origin and is immediately understood by patients, their families, providers, health care professionals, and the lay public of native English speakers. On the other hand, \"renal\" and \"nephrology,\" derived from Latin and Greek roots, respectively, commonly require interpretation and explanation. The Work Group and the NKF are committed to communicating in language that can be widely understood, hence the preferential use of \"kidney\" throughout these guidelines. The term \"End-Stage Renal Disease\" (ESRD) has been retained because of its administrative usage in the United States referring to patients treated by dialysis or transplantation, irrespective of their level of kidney function. Why Develop a New Classification? Currently, there is no uniform classification of the stages of chronic kidney disease. A review of textbooks and journal articles clearly demonstrates ambiguity and overlap in the meaning of current terms. The Work Group concluded that uniform definitions of terms and stages would improve communication between patients and providers, enhance public education, and promote dissemination of research results. In addition, it was believed that uniform definitions would enhance conduct of clinical research. Why Base a New Classification System on Severity of Disease? Adverse outcomes of kidney disease are based on the level of kidney function and risk of loss of function in the future. Chronic kidney disease tends to worsen over time. Therefore, the risk of adverse outcomes increases over time with disease severity. Many disciplines in medicine, including related specialties of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and transplantation, have adopted classification systems based on severity to guide clinical interventions, research, and professional and public education. Such a model is essential for any public health approach to disease. Why Classify Severity as the Level of GFR? The level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function in health and disease. Providers and patients are familiar with the concept that \"the kidney is like a filter.\" GFR is the best measure of the kidneys' ability to filter blood. In addition, expressing the level of kidney function on a continuous scale allows development of patient and public education programs that encourage individuals to \"Know your number!\" The term \"GFR\" is not intuitively evident to anyone. Rather, it is a learned term, which allows the ultimate expression of the complex functions of the kidney in one single numerical expression. Conversely, numbers are an intuitive concept and easily understandable by everyone.", "date": " 2002 ", "authors": ["Andrew S.

What does this new quantity mean, and why is assessment of heterogeneity so important to clinical practice? \n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide convincing and reliable evidence relevant to many aspects of medicine and health care.1 Their value is especially clear when the results of the studies they include show clinically important effects of similar magnitude. However, the conclusions are less clear when the included studies have differing results. In an attempt to establish whether studies are consistent, reports of meta-analyses commonly present a statistical test of heterogeneity. The test seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the variation in findings is compatible with chance alone (homogeneity). However, the test is susceptible to the number of trials included in the meta-analysis. We have developed a new quantity, I 2, which we believe gives a better measure of the consistency between trials in a meta-analysis.\n\nAssessment of the consistency of effects across studies is an essential part of meta-analysis. Unless we know how consistent the results of studies are, we cannot determine the generalisability of the findings of the meta-analysis. Indeed, several hierarchical systems for grading evidence state that the results of studies must be consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest grading.2\u20134\n\nTests for heterogeneity are commonly used to decide on methods for combining studies and for concluding consistency or inconsistency of findings.5 6 But what does the test achieve in practice, and how should the resulting P values be interpreted?\n\nA test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect.

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.   Design:  Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews .   Main outcome measure:  Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.   Results:  In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.   Conclusions:  A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.  Key messages  Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials  Funnel plots, plots of the trials9 effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases  Funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials  Funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews   Critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure", "date": " 1997 ", "authors": ["Matthias Egger", "George Davey Smith", "Martin Schneider", "Christoph Minder"], "related_topics": ["funnel plot", "publication bias", "meta-analysis", "bias *", "meta-analysis as topic *"], "citation_count": "34,542", "reference_count": "87", "references": ["2015795623", "2769264260", "2076983043", "2002374079", "2011932878", "2585382523", "1964435302", "2112339576", "1966953116", "2034562813", "2155132414"]}, {"id": "3135185800", "title": "British National Formulary", "abstract": null, "date": " 2000 ", "authors": ["Dinesh K.

Design Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews). Inclusion criteria Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen. Studies reviewed 287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. Main outcome measure \"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Results Overall, among these High risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P <0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000. Conclusions Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation, Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.", "date": " 2002 ", "authors": ["C Baigent", "C Sudlow", "R Collins", "R Peto", "Antithromboci Trialists Collaborat"], "related_topics": ["clopidogrel", "ticlopidine", "antiplatelet drug"], "citation_count": "11,011", "reference_count": "33", "references": []}, {"id": "2492141817", "title": "COLLABORATIVE OVERVIEW OF RANDOMIZED TRIALS OF ANTIPLATELET THERAPY .1.

Methods  The growth charts were developed with data from five national health examination surveys and limited supplemental data. Smoothed percentile curves were developed in two stages. In the first stage, selected empirical percentiles were smoothed with a variety of parametric and nonparametric procedures. In the second stage, parameters were created to obtain the final curves, additional percentiles and z-scores. The revised charts were evaluated using statistical and graphical measures.  Results  The 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts were revised for infants (birth to 36 months) and older children (2 to 20 years). New body mass index-for-age (BMI-for-age) charts were created. Use of national data improved the transition from the infant charts to those for older children. The evaluation of the charts found no large or systematic differences between the smoothed percentiles and the empirical data.  Conclusion  The 2000 CDC growth charts were developed with improved data and statistical procedures. Health care providers now have an instrument for growth screening that better represents the racial-ethnic diversity and combination of breast- and formula-feeding in the United States.

Discrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Because obese children tend to be taller than their nonoverweight peers, they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization. Many of the cardiovascular consequences that characterize adult-onset obesity are preceded by abnormalities that begin in childhood. Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and abnormal glucose tolerance occur with increased frequency in obese children and adolescents. The relationship of cardiovascular risk factors to visceral fat independent of total body fat remains unclear. Sleep apnea, pseudotumor cerebri, and Blount's disease represent major sources of morbidity for which rapid and sustained weight reduction is essential. Although several periods of increased risk appear in childhood, it is not clear whether obesity with onset early in childhood carries a greater risk of adult morbidity and mortality. Obesity is now the most prevalent nutritional disease of children and adolescents in the United States. Although obesity-associated morbidities occur more frequently in adults, significant consequences of obesity as well as the antecedents of adult disease occur in obese children and adolescents.

Relative mortality risks associated with different BMI levels were estimated from 3 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) trials covering the years 1971-1975 (NHANES I), 1976-1980 with follow up through 1992 (NHANES II), and 1988-1994 with follow up through 2000 (NHANES III), respectively.

Methods:  A nationally representative sample of 15,625 noninstitutionalized adults aged 20 years and older from the NHANES III was analyzed. Kidney function (GFR), kidney damage (albuminuria), and stages of CKD (GFR and albuminuria) were estimated from calibrated serum creatinine level, spot urine albumin level, age, sex, and race. GFR was estimated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and compared with the Cockcroft-Gault equation for creatinine clearance (CCr).  Results:  The prevalence of CKD in the US adult population was 11% (19.2 million). By stage, an estimated 5.9 million individuals (3.3%) had stage 1 (persistent albuminuria with a normal GFR), 5.3 million (3.0%) had stage 2 (persistent albuminuria with a GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), 7.6 million (4.3%) had stage 3 (GFR, 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), 400,000 individuals (0.2%) had stage 4 (GFR, 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and 300,000 individuals (0.2%) had stage 5, or kidney failure. Aside from hypertension and diabetes, age is a key predictor of CKD, and 11% of individuals older than 65 years without hypertension or diabetes had stage 3 or worse CKD. Compared with GFR estimates, CCr estimates showed a steeper decline with age and were lower in non-Hispanic blacks.

Persistence of microalbuminuria (>30 mg/g) was estimated from repeat visit data in NHANES 1988-1994. The GFR was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation reexpressed to standard serum creatinine.ResultsThe prevalence of both albuminuria and decreased GFR increased from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004. The prevalence of CKD stages 1 to 4 increased from 10.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2%-10.9%) in 1988-1994 to 13.1% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.1%) in 1999-2004 with a prevalence ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.4).

A higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and hypertension and higher body mass index explained the entire increase in prevalence of albuminuria but only part of the increase in the prevalence of decreased GFR. Estimation of GFR from serum creatinine has limited precision and a change in mean serum creatinine accounted for some of the increased prevalence of CKD.ConclusionsThe prevalence of CKD in the United States in 1999-2004 is higher than it was in 1988-1994.

(2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. (7) Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese.

We examined the relation between hours of television viewed and the prevalence of overweight in 1990, and the incidence and remission of overweight from 1986 to 1990 in a nationally representative cohort of 746 youths aged 10 to 15 years in 1990 whose mothers were 25 to 32 years old. Overweight was defined as a body mass index higher than the 85th percentile for age and gender.  Results:  We observed a strong dose-response relationship between the prevalence of overweight in 1990 and hours of television viewed. The odds of being overweight were 4.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 9.6) times greater for youth watching more than 5 hours of television per day compared with those watching for 0 to 2 hours. When adjustments were made for previous overweight (in 1986), baseline maternal overweight, socioeconomic status, household structure, ethnicity, and maternal and child aptitude test scores, results were similar (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 12.1). We also found significant relations between television viewing and increased incidence and decreased remission of overweight during this 4-year period, adjusted for baseline covariates. The adjusted odds of incidence were 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 26.5) times greater for youth watching more than 5 hours of television per day compared with those watching for 0 to 2 hours. Estimates of attributable risk indicate that more 60% of overweight incidence in this population can be linked to excess television viewing time.  Conclusion:  Television viewing affects overweight among youth, and reductions in viewing time could help prevent this increasingly common chronic health condition.

PCOS occurs in nearly 75% of cases of anovulatory infertility and over 80% of subjects with hirsutism.1 The typical biochemical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenaemia and an increase of serum luteinising hormone (LH) (with normal follicle stimulating hormone) but PCOS is also associated with a characteristic metabolic syndrome that includes hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia.1-4 These features are linked to a significantly increased risk of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes in later life and women with PCOS may also have a greater chance of developing premature cardiovascular disease.3 5 6 \n\nThe presence of polycystic ovaries is necessary for the development of the syndrome but not all women with polycystic ovaries have PCOS.

It typically presents with symptoms of anovulation associated with clinical and/or biochemical evidence of androgen excess, although its spectrum of presentation includes women with hyperandrogenism who have regular periods. It is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, and is now recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its aetiology remains unclear, but both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Typical biochemical features are raised serum concentrations of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, particularly in anovulatory women. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical criteria. A finding of raised serum testosterone and/or luteinizing hormone complements the clinical diagnosis. In obese women, an oral glucose tolerance test should be undertaken to detect impaired glucose tolerance. Management of PCOS includes treatment of infertility, menstrual regulation in women who do not desire pregnancy and treatment of associated symptoms of hyperandrogenism. Another important aspect of management is the introduction of diet and lifestyle changes for overweight and obese women with PCOS; this improves fertility and also helps prevent the possible long-term consequences of the metabolic disturbance characteristic of anovulatory women with PCOS.", "date": " 2001 ", "authors": ["Stephen Franks"], "related_topics": ["polycystic ovary", "anovulation", "hyperandrogenism", "infertility", "impaired glucose tolerance", "type 2 diabetes", "insulin resistance", "hirsutism", "physiology", "endocrinology", "medicine", "internal medicine"], "citation_count": "2,928", "reference_count": "5", "references": []}, {"id": "2894120069", "title": "Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Unattended Portable Monitors in the Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adult Patients", "abstract": null, "date": " 2007 ", "authors": ["W.

Clinical sleep evaluations using PM must be supervised by a practitioner with board certification in sleep medicine or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination. PM may be used as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA. PM is not appropriate for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant comorbid medical conditions that may degrade the accuracy of PM. PM is not appropriate for the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having comorbid sleep disorders. PM is not appropriate for general screening of asymptomatic populations. PM may be indicated for the diagnosis of OSA in patients for whom in-laboratory PSG is not possible by virtue of immobility, safety, or critical illness. PM may also be indicated to monitor the response to non-CPAP treatments for sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, PM must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation. The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors conventionally used for in-laboratory PSG should be used in PM.\r\n\r\nThe Task Force recommends that PM testing be performed under the auspices of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program with written policies and procedures. An experienced sleep technologist/technician must apply the sensors or directly educate patients in sensor application. The PM device must allow for display of raw data with the capability of manual scoring or editing of automated scoring by a qualified sleep technician/technologist. A board certified sleep specialist, or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination, must review the raw data from PM using scoring criteria consistent with current published AASM standards.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions specified above, PM may be used for unattended studies in the patient's home. A follow-up visit to review test results should be performed for all patients undergoing PM. Negative or technically inadequate PM tests in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA should prompt in-laboratory polysomnography.\r\n\r\nCitation:\r\nCollop NA; Anderson WM; Boehlecke B; Claman D; Goldberg R; Gottlieb DJ; Hudgel D; Sateia M; Schwab R.

The age-adjusted prevalence in the non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American populations was 32.4%, 23.3%, and 22.6%, respectively. Overall, two thirds of the population with hypertension were aware of their diagnosis (69%), and a majority were taking prescribed medication (53%).

To measure substitution patterns between drugs and other healthcare resources over the last 25 years and thus assess whether containing drug costs might result in higher expenditure elsewhere in the healthcare system. A production function approach was used, in which life expectancy was modelled as a function of per capita drugs and non-drug health-care resources, among other factors. Estimates are used to calculate a marginal rate of substitution, or trade-off, between drugs and non-drug healthcare resources, for a given level of life expectancy in the population. The model is estimated from a societal perspective, with panel data techniques using Canadian provincial-level data on health expenditure and spending on physicians per capita for the period 1980\u20132002, as well as individual survey data on lifestyle habits such as cigarette consumption and body mass index. Using life expectancy at birth for males as the production function, increasing drug spending by $Can1.00 (constant 2003 values) was accompanied by a decrease of $Can1.48 in non-drug, non-physician healthcare resources over the study period, without affecting life expectancy at birth. Results using life expectancy at birth for females as the production function showed a decrease of $Can1.05 in non-drug, non-physician healthcare resources over the same period. Using life expectancy as a general health indicator, results suggest that increases in drug spending could be more than offset by decreases in other healthcare spending without affecting the health of the population.

Microalbuminuria, self-reported cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular morbidity in the total study cohort, and additionally more detailed measurements in a subset of the total population. Results. Microalbuminuria (20-200 mg L-1) was present in 7.2% of the subjects and independently associated with age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, previous myocardial infarction and stroke. Some of these associations were already observed at albuminuria levels of 10-20 mg L-1. After exclusion of the diabetic and hypertensive subjects, microalbuminuria was still prevalent in 6.6% of the subjects. Conclusions. Microalbuminuria appears to be common not only in the general population but also in a nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population and is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors and cardio-vascular morbidity. Importantly, some of these associations are present at urinary albumin levels currently considered to be normal. These findings suggest that urinary albumin measurements may be useful in early risk profiling and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the population at large.", "date": " 2001 ", "authors": ["H.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  We analyzed data from a cohort of 51,529 U.S. male health professionals, 40-75 years of age in 1986, who completed biennial questionnaires sent out in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992.

Relative risks (RRs) associated with different anthropometrie measures were calculated controlling for age, and multivariate RRs were calculated controlling for smoking, family history of diabetes, and age.  RESULTS  We found a strong positive association between overall obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) and risk of diabetes. Men with a BMI of \u226535 kg/m 2  had a multivariate RR of 42.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0-80.6) compared with men with a BMI  2 .

Fat distribution, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), was a good predictor of diabetes only among the top 5%, while waist circumference was positively associated with the risk of diabetes among the top 20% of the cohort.  CONCLUSIONS  These data suggest that waist circumference may be a better indicator than WHR of the relationship between abdominal adiposity and risk of diabetes.

Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child\u2019s obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources.

Objective: We evaluated whether BMI adds to the predictive power of WC in assessing obesity-related comorbidity. Design: Subjects were 14 924 adult participants in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, grouped into categories of BMI and WC in accordance with the National Institutes of Health cutoffs. Odds ratios for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome were compared for overweight and class I obese BMI categories and the normal-weight category before and after adjustment for WC. BMI and WC were also included in the same regression model as continuous variables for prediction of the metabolic disorders. Results: With few exceptions, overweight and obese subjects were more likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome than were normal-weight subjects. After adjustment for WC category (normal or high), the odds of comorbidity, although attenuated, remained higher in overweight and obese subjects than in normal-weight subjects. However, after adjustment for WC as a continuous variable, the likelihood of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome was similar in all groups. When WC and BMI were used as continuous variables in the same regression model, WC alone was a significant predictor of comorbidity. Conclusions: WC, and not BMI, explains obesity-related health risk. Thus, for a given WC value, overweight and obese persons and normal-weight persons have comparable health risks. However, when WC is dichotomized as normal or high, BMI remains a significant predictor of health risk.

More specifically, epidemiology is concerned with the distribution of disease and death, and with their determinants and consequences in population groups. Inasmuch as patterns of health and disease are integral components of population change, epidemiology's reservoir of knowledge about these patterns and their determinants in population groups serves not only as a basis for prediction of population change but also as a source of hypotheses that can be further tested to correct, refine and build population theory.

Objective  To estimate rates of opioid overdose and their association with an average prescribed daily opioid dose among patients receiving medically prescribed, long-term opioid therapy.  Design  Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate overdose risk as a function of average daily opioid dose (morphine equivalents) received at the time of overdose.  Setting  HMO.  Patients  9940 persons who received 3 or more opioid prescriptions within 90 days for chronic noncancer pain between 1997 and 2005.  Measurements  Average daily opioid dose over the previous 90 days from automated pharmacy data. Primary outcomes--nonfatal and fatal overdoses--were identified through diagnostic codes from inpatient and outpatient care and death certificates and were confirmed by medical record review.  Results  51 opioid-related overdoses were identified, including 6 deaths. Compared with patients receiving 1 to 20 mg/d of opioids (0.2% annual overdose rate), patients receiving 50 to 99 mg/d had a 3.7-fold increase in overdose risk (95% CI, 1.5 to 9.5) and a 0.7% annual overdose rate.

Despite this finding, hospital discharge procedures have not been standardized (3). In addition, the declining presence of primary care providers (PCPs) in hospitals has not been adequately accompanied by systems to ensure that patient data are transferred to subsequent caregivers (4, 5). For example, discharge summaries frequently lack critical data and are not sent to the PCP in a timely fashion (6, 7), resulting in outpatient clinicians being unaware of test results that were pending at discharge (8) and evaluations that were scheduled to be done after discharge not being completed (9). Similarly, patients are often left unprepared at discharge; many do not understand their discharge medications and cannot recall their chief diagnoses (10).

Since a similar dyslipidaemia occurs with the acute-phase response, we investigated whether elevated acute-phase/stress reactants (the innate immune system\u2019s response to environmental stress) and their major cytokine mediator (interleukin-6, IL-6) are associated with NIDDM and syndrome X, and may thus provide a unifying pathophysiological mechanism for these conditions. Two groups of Caucasian subjects with NIDDM were studied. Those with any 4 or 5 features of syndrome X (n = 19) were compared with a group with 0 or 1 feature of syndrome X (n = 25) but similar age, sex distribution, diabetes duration, glycaemic control and diabetes treatment. Healthy non-diabetic subjects of comparable age and sex acted as controls. Overnight urinary albumin excretion rate, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, was also assayed in subjects to assess its relationship to the acute-phase response. Serum sialic acid was confirmed as a marker of the acute-phase response since serum concentrations were significantly related to established acute-phase proteins such as \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). There was a significant graded increase of serum sialic acid, \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein, IL-6 and urinary albumin excretion rate amongst the three groups, with the lowest levels in non-diabetic subjects, intermediate levels in NIDDM patients without syndrome X and highest levels in NIDDM patients with syndrome X. C-reactive protein and cortisol levels were also higher in syndrome X-positive compared to -negative patients and serum amyloid A was higher in both diabetic groups than in the control group. We conclude that NIDDM is associated with an elevated acute-phase response, particularly in those with features of syndrome X.

Design: A stepwise selection procedure, adjusting for age and sex, was used in 2693 subjects with complete data to determine which risk factors for coronary artery disease should be included in a Cox proportional hazards model.  Subjects: 3055 white patients (mean age 52) with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and without evidence of disease related to atheroma. Median duration of follow up was 7.9 years. 335 patients developed coronary artery disease within 10 years.  Outcome measures: Angina with confirmatory abnormal electrocardiogram; non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction.  Results: Coronary artery disease was significantly associated with increased concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased triglyceride concentration, haemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and a history of smoking. The estimated hazard ratios for the upper third relative to the lower third were 2.26 (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.00) for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.55 (0.41 to 0.73) for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.52 (1.15 to 2.01) for haemoglobin A1c, and 1.82 (1.34 to 2.47) for systolic blood pressure.

Furthermore, the extent to which the above-mentioned factors could contribute to the excessive cardiovascular mortality observed in diabetic patients was examined. In the years 1979\u20131981, altogether 133 (70 men, 63 women) newly-diagnosed patients with Type 2 diabetes and 144 (62 men, 82 women) non-diabetic control subjects aged 45\u201364 years were studied. Both groups were re-examined in the years 1985\u20131986 and 1991\u20131992. The impact of different factors on cardiovascular mortality was examined by univariate analyses after adjustment for age and sex and by multiple logistic regression analyses. The age-standardized total and cardiovascular mortality rates were substantially higher in diabetic men (17.8 and 15.0%, total and cardiovascular mortality, respectively p = 0.06 and NS) and women (18.5 and 16.6%, p<0.01 for both) than in non-diabetic control men (5.2 % both total and cardiovascular mortality) and women (4.2 and 2.2 %). Cardiovascular mortality was not related to the treatment modality (diet, oral drugs, insulin) at 5 years from diagnosis. Use of diuretics, beta-blocking agents or their combination at baseline did not make a significant contribution to cardiovascular mortality either. In multiple logistic regression analysis on diabetic patients, age, LDL triglycerides, smoking, blood glucose and ischaemic ECG at baseline had independent associations with cardiovascular mortality. Interestingly, urinary albumin excretion rate measured at 5-year examination also predicted 10-year cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for the effects of major risk factors including lipoprotein abnormalities, but its predictive power reduced to a nonsignificant level when the effect of plasma glucose was taken into account. The relative risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with diabetes was 8.2 after allowing for age alone, but it declined to 3.7 when all contributing factors from the baseline examination (except blood glucose) were taken into account. In conclusion, the present results indicate that LDL triglycerides and/or other changes in lipoprotein composition characteristic of Type 2 diabetes and manifesting as elevated serum triglycerides are atherogenic and they strongly predict increased cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the consequences of long-term hyperglycaemia could explain a large proportion of the remaining excessive cardiovascular mortality risk among Type 2 diabetic patients.", "date": " 1993 ", "authors": ["M.

Participants  A group of 1295 ethnically diverse grade 6 and 7 students from public schools in 4 Massachusetts communities.  Intervention  Students participated in a school-based interdisciplinary intervention over 2 school years. Planet Health sessions were included within existing curricula using classroom teachers in 4 major subjects and physical education. Sessions focused on decreasing television viewing, decreasing consumption of high-fat foods, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and increasing moderate and vigorous physical activity.  Main Outcome Measures  Obesity was defined as a composite indicator based on both a body mass index and a triceps skinfold value greater than or equal to age- and sex-specific 85th percentiles.

However, evidence is needed about side effects, efficacy, and risk of misuse or addiction.   Methods:  This meta-analysis was carried out with these objectives: to compare the efficacy of opioids for CNCP with other drugs and placebo; to identify types of CNCP that respond better to opioids; and to determine the most common side effects of opioids. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (up to May 2005) and reference lists for randomized controlled trials of any opioid administered by oral or transdermal routes or rectal suppositories for CNCP (defined as pain for longer than 6 mo). Extracted outcomes included pain, function or side effects. Methodological quality was assessed with the Jadad instrument; analyses were conducted with Revman 4.2.7.   Results:  Included were 41 randomized trials involving 6019 patients: 80% of the patients had nociceptive pain (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or back pain); 12%, neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy or phantom limb pain); 7%, fibromyalgia; and 1%, mixed pain. The methodological quality of 87% of the studies was high. The opioids studied were classified as weak (tramadol, propoxyphene, codeine) or strong (morphine, oxycodone). Average duration of treatment was 5 (range 1\u201316) weeks. Dropout rates averaged 33% in the opioid groups and 38% in the placebo groups. Opioids were more effective than placebo for both pain and functional outcomes in patients with nociceptive or neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Strong, but not weak, opioids were significantly superior to naproxen and nortriptyline, and only for pain relief. Among the side effects of opioids, only constipation and nausea were clinically and statistically significant.   Interpretation:  Weak and strong opioids outperformed placebo for pain and function in all types of CNCP.

In IDDM these changes are small or absent if good metabolic control can be maintained. Diabetic nephropathy is, however, associated with the appearance of dyslipoproteinemia. In NIDDM plasma total and VLDL triglyceride levels are elevated, and HDL-cholesterol level is decreased, and this pattern of dyslipoproteinemia does not always respond to improved control of hyperglycemia. Abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, not reflected in conventional plasma lipid and lipoprotein level measurements, and glucosylation of lipoproteins and resulting alterations in lipoprotein catabolism may be of importance in the enhanced atherogenesis in diabetes. Both IDDM and NIDDM are associated with an increased frequency of hypertension, but the underlying mechanisms appear to be different. In IDDM hypertension is usually associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy and thus with a long duration of the disease. In NIDDM hypertension is often present already at the time of diagnosis, and also in IGT, the precursor stage of NIDDM, the prevalence of hypertension is already increased. Obesity explains only in part the high prevalence of hypertension in patients with NIDDM. Diabetes is known to be associated with multiple abnormalities in hemostatic factors and, although these abnormalities may contribute importantly to the increased risk of ASVD in diabetic patients, information about their real role is scanty and conflicting. The impact of general major risk factors for ASVD, elevated plasma cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and smoking, on the risk of ASVD appears to be similar in diabetics and nondiabetics. Only a relatively small proportion of the excessive occurrence of ASVD in diabetics can, however, be explained by the effects of diabetes on the levels of general risk factors for ASVD. This proportion mediated through the effects of diabetes on risk factors is larger in female diabetics than in male diabetics.

This study systematically reviewed the literature to determine the extent of agreement between subjectively (self-report e.g. questionnaire, diary) and objectively (directly measured; e.g. accelerometry, doubly labeled water) assessed physical activity in adults. Eight electronic databases were searched to identify observational and experimental studies of adult populations. Searching identified 4,463 potential articles. Initial screening found that 293 examined the relationship between self-reported and directly measured physical activity and met the eligibility criteria. Data abstraction was completed for 187 articles, which described comparable data and/or comparisons, while 76 articles lacked comparable data or comparisons, and a further 30 did not meet the review's eligibility requirements. A risk of bias assessment was conducted for all articles from which data was abstracted. Correlations between self-report and direct measures were generally low-to-moderate and ranged from -0.71 to 0.96. No clear pattern emerged for the mean differences between self-report and direct measures of physical activity.

A randomized, open, long-term, repeated-dose comparison of an anti-inflammatory drug and two opioid regimens in 36 patients with back pain. Objectives. To examine the long-term safety and efficacy of chronic opioid therapy in a randomized trial of patients with back pain. Methods. All participants underwent a 4-week washout period of no opioid medication before being randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens for 16 weeks: 1) naproxen only, 2) set-dose oxycodone, or 3) titrated-dose oxycodone and sustained-release morphine sulfate.

Each patient was called once a week for a report on pain, activity, mood, medication, hours awake, and adverse effects and was monitored carefully for signs of abuse and noncompliance. Results. Weekly reports during the experimental phase showed the titrated-dose group to have less pain (P < 0.001) and less emotional distress (P< 0.001) than the other two groups.

Some surveys report good pain relief and improvement in performance while others suggest a poor outcome with a propensity to psychological dependence or addiction.    Methods  We undertook a randomised double-blind crossover study to test the hypothesis that oral morphine relieves pain and improves the quality of life in patients with chronic regional pain of soft tissue or musculoskeletal origin who have not responded to codeine, antiinflammatory agents, and antidepressants. Morphine was administered as a sustained-release preparation in doses up to 60 mg twice daily and compared with benztropine (active placebo) in doses up to 1 mg twice daily over three-week titration, six-week evaluation, and two-week washout phases. Pain intensity, pain relief, and drug liking were rated weekly and psychological features, functional status, and cognition were assessed at baseline and at the end of each evaluation phase.    Findings  After dose titration in the 46 patients who completed the study, the mean daily doses of drugs were morphine 83\u00b75 mg and benztropine 1\u00b77 mg. On visual analogue scales, the morphine group showed a reduction in pain intensity relative to placebo in period I (p=0\u00b701) and this group also fared better in a crossover analysis of the sum of pain intensity differences from baseline (p=0\u00b702). No other significant differences were detected.

First, institutional racism can lead to limited opportunities for socioeconomic mobility, differential access to goods and resources, and poor living conditions that can adversely affect cardiovascular health. Second, perceived/personally mediated racism acts as a stressor and can induce psychophysiological reactions that negatively affect cardiovascular health. Third, in race-conscious societies, such as the United States, the negative self-evaluations of accepting negative cultural stereotypes as true (internalized racism) can have deleterious effects on cardiovascular health.

This debate is driven by a new willingness to consider the potential -benefits of an approach that has been traditionally rejected as invariably, ineffective and unsafe. The published literature continues to be very limited, but a growing clinical experience, combined with a critical reevaluation of issues related to efficacy, safety, and addiction or abuse, suggests that there is a subpopulation of patients with chronic pain that can achieve sustained partial analgesia from opioid therapy without the occurrence of intolerable side effects or the development of aberrant drug-related behaviors. Future research must confirm this impression, through controlled clinical trials and clarify those factors that may predict therapeutic success or failure.

We undertook a study designed to quantify and describe the prevalence and distribution of chronic pain in the community.  Methods  A random sample of 5036 patients, aged 25 and over, was drawn from 29 general practices in the Grampian region of the UK and surveyed by a postal self-completion questionnaire. The questionnaire included case-screening questions, a question on the cause of the pain, the chronic pain grade questionnaire, the level of expressed needs questionnaire, and sociodemographic questions.  Findings  3605 questionnaires were returned completed. 1817 (50\u00b74%) of patients self reported chronic pain, equivalent to 46\u00b75% of the general population. 576 reported back pain and 570 reported arthritis; these were the most common complaints and accounted for a third of all complaints. Backward stepwise logistic-regression modelling identified age, sex, housing tenure, and employment status as significant predictors of the presence of chronic pain in the community. 703 (48\u00b77%) individuals with chronic pain had the least severe grade of pain, and 228 (15\u00b78%) the most severe grade. Of those who reported chronic pain, 312 (17\u00b72%) reported no expressed need, and 509 (28\u00b70%) reported the highest expressed need.

DESIGN: We analyzed medical examiner data for all unintentional drug overdose deaths in New Mexico, USA, between 1998 and 2002. MEASUREMENTS: Age-adjusted death rates for methadone-related death, logistic regression models for likelihood of methadone-related death among all unintentional drug overdose deaths and bivariate comparisons within methadone-related death. FINDINGS: Of 1120 drug overdose deaths during this period, there were 143 (12.8%) methadone-related deaths; the death rate decreased over the time period, averaging 1.6 per 100,000. Of 143 methadone-related deaths, 22.4% were due to methadone alone, 23.8% were due to methadone/prescription drugs (no illicit drugs), 50.3% were due to methadone/illicit drugs and 3.5% were due to methadone/alcohol. These groups were significantly different in demographics, health history and circumstances of death. Of 79 decedents (55.2%) with a known source of methadone, 68 obtained methadone through a physician prescription (31 for methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), 27 for managing pain and 10 had unknown reason for prescription). CONCLUSIONS: Methadone-related death rates and the proportion of methadone-related death among all drug overdose deaths decreased in New Mexico from 1998 to 2002. It is important for surveillance of methadone-related death to assess multiple drug causes, not just underlying cause. Also, methadone for pain management must be examined alongside MMT and when possible, methadone co-intoxication should be described in the context of other drugs causing death.

We standardized yearly overdose death rates by age, sex and race to the 1990 census population for NYC to enable comparability between years relevant to this analysis. Findings Opiates, cocaine and alcohol were the three drugs most commonly attributed as the cause of accidental overdose death by the OCME, accounting for 97.6% of all deaths; 57.8% of those deaths were attributed to two or more of these three drugs in combination. Accidental overdose deaths increased in 1990\u201093 and subsequently declined slightly in 1993\u201098. Changes in the rate of multi-drug combination deaths accounted for most of the change in overdose death rates, whereas single drug overdose death rates remained relatively stable.

Methods: CONSORT (CONsortium to Study Opioid Risks and Trends) includes adult members of 2 health plans serving over 1% of the US population. Opioid use episodes beginning in the years 1997 to 2005 were classified as acute, episodic, long-term/ lower dose, or long-term/higher dose. Results: On the basis of evaluation of the likelihood of opioid use continuing, long-term opioid therapy was defined by episodes lasting longer than 90 days with 10+ opioid prescriptions or 120+ days supply of opioids dispensed. Long-term/ higher dose episodes ( < 1.5% of all opioid use episodes) were characterized by daily or near daily use, a mean duration of about 1000 days, and an average daily dose of about 55mg. They accounted for more than half the total morphine equivalents dispensed from the years 1997 to 2006. Short-acting, non-Schedule II opioids (eg, hydrocodone with acetaminophen) were, by far, the most commonly prescribed medications for acute, episodic, and long-term episodes. Long-acting (sustained- release) opioids were the predominately prescribed medication in a minority of long-term episodes (6% to 12%). Discussion: Long-term opioid therapy was characterized by the diversity in medications prescribed, dosage levels, and frequency of use.

A central theme throughout is the need to strike a balance between risk management strategies to prevent and deter prescription opioid abuse and the need for physicians and patients to have appropriate access to opioid pharmaceuticals for the treatment of pain. The epidemiology of prescription opioid use and abuse is reviewed. Non-medical use and abuse of prescription opioids are on the rise in the United States, illicit use of several widely prescribed opioids has increased disproportionately more than licit use, and the prevalence of prescription opioid abuse appears to be similar to that of heroin and cocaine abuse. There is a paucity of abuse liability testing of prescription opioids, and methods should be developed to fill critical gaps in our knowledge in this area. The role of regulatory agencies in preventing diversion of prescription opioids and identifying potential sources of diversion are discussed. More research is needed to identify those populations most at risk for abusing prescription opioids, and then to develop appropriately targeted prevention programs. Treatment options are discussed; these depend on whether or not an abuser is in pain. Prescription opioid abuse has harmful ramifications for the legitimate and appropriate use of opioids, including stigmatization, opiophobia, and undertreatment of pain.

This concept recently gained momentum with the 2004 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Chapters-, International Association for the Study of Pain- and World Health Organization-sponsored \"Global Day Against Pain,\" where it was adopted as a central theme. We survey the scope of the problem of unrelieved pain in three areas, acute pain, chronic noncancer pain, and cancer pain, and outline the adverse physical and psychological effects and social and economic costs of untreated pain. Reasons for deficiencies in pain management include cultural, societal, religious, and political attitudes, including acceptance of torture. The biomedical model of disease, focused on pathophysiology rather than quality of life, reinforces entrenched attitudes that marginalize pain management as a priority. Strategies currently applied for improvement include framing pain management as an ethical issue; promoting pain management as a legal right, providing constitutional guarantees and statutory regulations that span negligence law, criminal law, and elder abuse; defining pain management as a fundamental human right, categorizing failure to provide pain management as professional misconduct, and issuing guidelines and standards of practice by professional bodies. The role of the World Health Organization is discussed, particularly with respect to opioid availability for pain management. We conclude that, because pain management is the subject of many initiatives within the disciplines of medicine, ethics and law, we are at an \"inflection point\" in which unreasonable failure to treat pain is viewed worldwide as poor medicine, unethical practice, and an abrogation of a fundamental human right.", "date": " 2007 ", "authors": ["Frank Brennan", "Daniel B.

Pedometer-determined physical activity indices are needed to guide their efforts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the rationale and evidence for general pedometer-based indices for research and practice purposes. Specifically, we evaluate popular recommendations for steps/day and attempt to translate existing physical activity guidelines into steps/day equivalents. Also, we appraise the fragmented evidence currently available from associations derived from cross-sectional studies and a limited number of interventions that have documented improvements (primarily in body composition and/or blood pressure) with increased steps/day. A value of 10 000 steps/day is gaining popularity with the media and in practice and can be traced to Japanese walking clubs and a business slogan 30+ years ago. 10 000 steps/day appears to be a reasonable estimate of daily activity for apparently healthy adults and studies are emerging documenting the health benefits of attaining similar levels. Preliminary evidence suggests that a goal of 10 000 steps/day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases. Another concern about using 10 000 steps/ day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population in the war against obesity. Other approaches to pedometer-determined physical activity recommendations that are showing promise of health benefit and individual sustainability have been based on incremental improvements relative to baseline values. Based on currently available evidence, we propose the following preliminary indices be used to classify pedometer-determined physical activity in healthy adults: (i)  12 500 steps/day are likely to be classified as \u2018highly active\u2019.", "date": " 2004 ", "authors": ["Catrine Tudor-Locke", "David R.

Literature searches were conducted using predefined keywords in 6 key databases. A total of 11,088 potential papers were identified.

The evidence was graded for each health outcome using established criteria based on the quantity and quality of studies and strength of effect. The volume, intensity, and type of physical activity were considered. Physical activity was associated with numerous health benefits. The dose-response relations observed in observational studies indicate that the more physical activity, the greater the health benefit. Results from experimental studies indicate that even modest amounts of physical activity can have health benefits in high-risk youngsters (e.g., obese). To achieve substantive health benefits, the physical activity should be of at least a moderate intensity. Vigorous intensity activities may provide even greater benefit. Aerobic-based activities had the greatest health benefit, other than for bone health, in which case high-impact weight bearing activities were required. The following recommendations were made: 1) Children and youth 5-17 years of age should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes per day and up to several hours of at least moderate intensity physical activity. Some of the health benefits can be achieved through an average of 30 minutes per day.

Evidence supporting the opioid responsiveness of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, includes multiple randomized trials conducted over months (up to 8 months). Observational studies are conducted for longer, and many also support opioid analgesic efficacy. Concerns have arisen about loss of efficacy with prolonged use, possibly related to tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Mechanisms of tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia are explored. Evidence on other important outcomes such as improvement in function and quality of life is mixed, and is less convincing than evidence supporting analgesic efficacy. It is clear from current evidence that many patients abandon chronic opioid therapy because of the unacceptability of side effects. There are also concerns about toxicity, especially when opioids are used in high doses for prolonged periods, related to hormonal and immune function. The issue of addiction during opioid treatment of chronic pain is also explored. Addiction issues present many complex questions that have not been satisfactorily answered. Opioid treatment of pain has been, and remains, severely hampered because of actual and legal constraints related to addiction risk. Pain advocacy has focused on placing addiction risk into context so that addiction fears do not compromise effective treatment of pain. On the other hand, denying addiction risk during opioid treatment of chronic pain has not been helpful in terms of providing physicians with the tools needed for safe chronic opioid therapy. Here, a structured goal-directed approach to chronic opioid treatment is suggested; this aims to select and monitor patients carefully, and wean therapy if treatment goals are not reached. Chronic opioid therapy for pain has not been a universal success since it was re-established during the last two decades of the twentieth century. It is now realized that the therapy is not as effective or as free from addiction risk as was once thought. Knowing this, many ethical dilemmas arise, especially in relation to patients' right to treatment competing with physicians' need to offer the treatment selectively.

Methods:    This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study included 159 subjects with moderate to severe pain due to diabetic neuropathy. Treatment began with either one 10-mg tablet of CR oxycodone (n = 82) or identical placebo (n = 77) every 12 hours.

METHODS: A state-representative sample in Victoria, Australia (n = 1792) participated in a 10-wave longitudinal study and was followed from age 15 to 35 years. Exposure variable: Patterns of cannabis use across 20\u2009years. Outcomes at age 35: Alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, relationship status, financial hardship, depression, anxiety and employment status. RESULTS: Substantially more participants (13.6%) initiated regular use after high school (young-adult onset) than in adolescence (7.7%, adolescent onset). By the mid-30s, both young-adult and adolescent-onset regular users were more likely than minimal/non-users (63.5%) to have used other illicit drugs (odds ratio [OR]\u2009>\u200920.4), be a high-risk alcohol drinker (OR\u2009>\u20093.7), smoked daily (OR\u2009>\u20097.2) and less likely to be in relationships (OR\u2009<\u20090.4). As the prevalence of the young-adult-onset group was nearly double of the adolescent-onset group, it accounted for a higher proportion of adverse consequences than the adolescent-onset group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users who began regular use in their teens had poorer later life outcomes than non-using peers. The larger group who began regular cannabis use after leaving high school accounted for most cannabis-related harms in adulthood.

Study Selection  Randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids for the following indications: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome.  Data Extraction and Synthesis  Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. All review stages were conducted independently by 2 reviewers.

DESIGN A prospective epidemiologic study among HIV-infected and non-infected IVDU in Amsterdam. SETTING We analysed patients attending the Municipal Health Service of Amsterdam. PATIENTS The patient group consisted of 197 HIV-seropositive IVDU and 193 HIV-seronegative IVDU as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We analysed incidence rates per person-year of bacterial pneumonia; hospitalizations and non-AIDS mortality; and relative risks for HIV-infected IVDU compared to non-infected IVDU. RESULTS The incidence of bacterial pneumonia rose from 0.1 in 1986 to 0.29 in 1989 in HIV-infected IVDU. The overall relative risk for this group was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-9.7) compared with non-infected controls. HIV-infected IVDU were more frequently hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia than non-infected IVDU (50 versus 13%). In contrast, non-AIDS mortality rates remained stable for both HIV-infected and non-infected IVDU. HIV seropositivity was not found to be an independent risk factor for non-AIDS mortality. CONCLUSION We found a high and rising incidence of bacterial pneumonia among HIV-infected IVDU in Amsterdam without any consequential rise in non-AIDS mortality. This contrasts with reports from studies conducted in New York City, New York, USA, where bacterial pneumonia-related mortality has been found to increase markedly, coincident with the AIDS epidemic. Early detection of bacterial pneumonia and easy access to both inpatient and outpatient medical care may be important factors in preventing early death due to common bacterial pathogens in IVDU without AIDS.", "date": " 1992 ", "authors": ["G.

DESIGN--This was a retrospective analysis of 1989 data on injecting drug users and mortality obtained from three independent agencies: the Procurator Fiscal's Office, the General Register Office, and the Scottish HIV-test register. SETTING--Greater Glasgow, Scotland. SUBJECTS--Drug injectors, estimated population 9424. MAIN RESULTS--81 names were found using the three sources to identify deaths. After removing duplicates, 51 deaths were found. This represented a mortality rate of 0.54% in the estimated population. Among female injectors the mortality rate was 0.85%, significantly higher than the rate of 0.42% among male injectors (95% CI for the true difference in mortality rates between female and male injectors was 0.31%-0.55%). Over 90% of deaths were attributed to overdose or suicide. Although AIDS caused only one death, 19% of cases (5/27) whose HIV antibody status could be ascertained were positive. The mortality rate among HIV positive injectors (3.8%) was significantly higher than among HIV negative injectors (0.49%). CONCLUSIONS--Comprehensive coverage using three data sources revealed a far greater annual number of all cause deaths among injectors than would have been expected from previous research. The observed mortality rate was lower than in previous studies where the denominators used to calculate rates had an element of underenumeration.

For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nTo determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain.\r\n\r\nSearch methods\r\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.\r\n\r\nSelection criteria\r\nRCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.\r\n\r\nData collection and analysis\r\nTwo review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. In this update a total of sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion (including 11 additional studies (778 participants)) Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.\r\n\r\nMain results\r\nSixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nAuthors' conclusions\r\nThis update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs.

Available evidence suggests a continued wide variance in the use of opioids, as documented by different medical specialties, medical boards, advocacy groups, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Objectives  The objectives of opioid guidelines by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) are to provide guidance for the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain, to bring consistency in opioid philosophy among the many diverse groups involved, to improve the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain, and to reduce the incidence of abuse and drug diversion.  Design  A broadly based policy committee of recognized experts in the field evaluated the available literature regarding opioid use in managing chronic non-cancer pain. This resulted in the formulation of the review and update of the guidelines published in 2006, a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions, followed by statements regarding the relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.  Methods  The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, consensus evaluation, open forum presentations, formal endorsement by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and peer review. Based on the criteria of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the quality of evidence was designated as Level I, II, and III, with 3 subcategories in Level II, with Level I described as strong and Level III as indeterminate. The recommendations were provided from 1A to 2C, varying from strong recommendation with high quality evidence to weak recommendation with low-quality or very low-quality evidence.  Results  After an extensive review and analysis of the literature, which included systematic reviews and all of the available literature, the evidence for the effectiveness of long-term opioids in reducing pain and improving functional status for 6 months or longer is variable. The evidence for transdermal fentanyl and sustained-release morphine is Level II-2, whereas for oxycodone the level of evidence is II-3, and the evidence for hydrocodone and methadone is Level III. There is also significant evidence of misuse and abuse of opioids. The recommendation is 2A - weak recommendation, high-quality evidence: with benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens; with evidence derived from RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies, with the implication that with a weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values.  Conclusion  Opioids are commonly prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain and may be effective for short-term pain relief. However, long-term effectiveness of 6 months or longer is variable with evidence ranging from moderate for transdermal fentanyl and sustained-release morphine with a Level II-2, to limited for oxycodone with a Level II-3, and indeterminate for hydrocodone and methadone with a Level III. These guidelines included the evaluation of the evidence for the use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain and the recommendations for that management. These guidelines are based on the best available evidence and do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. Because of the changing body of evidence, this document is not intended to be a \"standard of care.\"", "date": " 2008 ", "authors": ["Andrea M Trescot", "Standiford Helm", "Hans Hansen", "Ramsin Benyamin", "Scott E Glaser", "Rajive Adlaka", "Samir Patel", "Laxmaiah Manchikanti"], "related_topics": ["evidence-based medicine", "oxycodone", "methadone", "drug diversion", "systematic review", "opioid", "hydrocodone", "guideline", "family medicine", "medicine", "analgesics, opioid / adverse effects", "analgesics, opioid / economics"], "citation_count": "592", "reference_count": "284", "references": ["2106952837", "2092467722", "2133915381", "2167613032", "2023153884", "2529171869", "1969646198", "2079065919", "2011487877", "2148694444"]}, {"id": "2124239698", "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain: A Joint Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society", "abstract": "Recommendation 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause.

Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood (ML)-based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step ML method can be easily implemented in software for LC analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their SEs can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the ML method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step ML estimation.", "date": " 2010 ", "authors": ["Jeroen K.

The proportion of drug users who reported borrowing and lending used injection equipment and reusing needles/syringes (in the previous 6 months), continuously declined from 51% to 20%, from 46% to 10% and from 63% to 39%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, it appeared unlikely that a selective recruitment of participants over time was responsible for these trends. Participants, recruited later in time, had been previously tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) more often, had received daily methadone less often, and had obtained a higher proportion of new needles via exchange programs. Indications were found that (1) voluntary HIV testing and counseling leads to less borrowing, lending, and reusing equipment; and (2) obtaining nee...", "date": " 1994 ", "authors": ["E. J. C.

Design: A comprehensive, open cohort study of drug users on the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Methods: From 1986 to 1994, injection drug users in Amsterdam were included in the study. Incidence rates of self-reported skin abscesses and verified episodes of endocarditis were calculated. In uni- and multivariate Poisson regression analysis, risk factors for skin abscesses and endocarditis were determined. Results: 521 HIV-seronegative and 237 HIV-seropositive IDU were followed for 1640 person-years. A total of 545 skin abscesses were reported by 269 IDU (incidence 33/100 person-years). HIV infection, female gender, prostitution among females, foreign nationality, injection of heroin and cocaine, a high frequency of injecting, and obtaining syringes through the needle exchange program were independently and positively associated with skin abscesses. During follow-up, 17 verified episodes of endocarditis were observed (incidence    1.3  100    personyears). Endocarditis was independently associated with HIV infection and a previous history of endocarditis. Furthermore, women and IDU with a skin abscess appeared to be at an increased risk for endocarditis. Conclusions: HIV infection is an independent risk factor for skin abscesses and endocarditis. Also, women are at an increased risk for these injection-related infections.

Greater involvement in marijuana use was associated with greater value on independence than on academic achievement, lower expectations for academic achievement, lesser religiosity, greater tolerance of deviance, less compatibility between friends and parents, greater influence of friends relative to parents, greater models and support for problem behavior, greater actual involvement in other problem behaviors such as drunkenness, and less involvement in conventional behavior such as attending church.

The pattern is nearly identical to the pattern that accounts for problem drinking in these same adolescents.

Whether there is an increased mortality in cancer among schizophrenic patients remains a controversial issue. A reduced mortality, and particularly a reduced suicide rate, must be an important aim for any treatment policy or therapeutic program. The use of computerized patient data bases, linked to cause-of-death registers, is recommended to permit regular followup studies of large patient populations and facilitate the access to medical records and death records for more detailed analyses. A 10-year followup of 1,190 patients with schizophrenia, selected from the Stockholm County inpatient register is described. The overall mortality was more than twice that in the general population, and the mortality in suicide was more than 10 times higher. The inpatient register was used to identify hospital episodes.

In 10 subjects, naloxone administered 1, 2 and 4 hr before a test dose of morphine antagonized the effects of morphine.

In three subjects, no behavioral or physiologic changes were observed during chronic administration and withdrawal of naloxone; however, the ability of naioxone to antagonize the effects of a test dose of morphine persisted.
