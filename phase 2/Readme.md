## Machine Learning Models usage in Information Retrieval

### Brief summary:

Implementing a movie recommender system by embedding movies synopsis text by Word2Vec and TF-IDF methods to a reduced dimension subspace and applying Neural Networks and probabilistic models to recommend.

Dataset: movies_train.csv, movies_text.csv (from kaggle)

Libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- sklearn
- src

### Tasks:

1. Dimentionality Reduction:
    - Word2Vec
    -  TF_IDF  

2. Classification
    - Naive Bayes
    - KNN
    - SVM
    - Neural Network

3. Clustering
    - K-means
    - Gaussian Mixture Models
    - Hierarchical Clustering
 
4. Evaluation:
    - F_score, Precision, Recall
    - Purity
    - ARI
